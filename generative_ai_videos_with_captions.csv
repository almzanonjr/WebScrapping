"Just Happened! Elon Musk Announces Tesla Bot Optimus Next Gen 3 Securities, Durability &amp; Production!",TESLA CAR WORLD,2024-09-04T12:29:28Z,MsLvoZ1kqzU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsLvoZ1kqzU,"but we we expect to have several thousand Optimus robots um produced and doing useful things by the end of next year uh in the teses of factories and then in 2026 ramping up production quite a bit um and at that point we'll be providing Optimus robots to uh outside customers $580,000 is the amount of money a business can save over 20 years in labor cost by purchasing a security guard Tesla bot for 20 grand instead of hiring a human worker for $600,000 over this time imagine how much money you can save with your current company size actually deciding between humans and robots could be a complete GameChanger no benefits no vacations and no fatigue you don't have Healthcare injuries or workplace drama either Tesla bot can operate continuously replacing humans with savings up to 30 times cheaper so how is Tesla bot Superior and why does Elon Musk pursue it so persistently what is the expected lifespan of these robots when we talk about the Tesla bot we're looking at a robot that's built to last Elon and his Tesla team have focused on making a robot with an estimated lifespan of 15 to 20 years and this isn't just a number pulled out of thin air it's backed by careful design choices quality materials and advanced technology 20 years is an admirable number for a humanoid robot on the market today actually the atlas primarily designed for research and development has an expected lifespan of 5 to 10 years this is a bit shorter about four times less than the projected 20-year lifespan of the Tesla bot unry on the other hand produces a range of models including the unry H1 and G1 designed for various applications like research and entertainment the H1 model for example typically has a lifespan of 5 to 7 years with regular maintenance this is even shorter potentially half of what the atlas is and a full 15 years less than the 20-year lifespan Tesla aims to achieve with Tesla bot the great achievement of Tesla bot is the combination of many Advanced manufacturing and Technology factors that Tesla possesses Tesla uses durable materials like aluminum Alloys and composite Plastics in Tesla bot's construction these materials aren't just for show they're built to resist wear and tear ensuring that the bot stays working for years Tesla Bots equipped with a sophisticated control system that learns and adapts over time this system optimizes the Bots operations reducing mechanical wear and tear and minimizing the risk of breakdowns the result a robot that not only works better over time but also lasts longer moreover Tesla advancements in lithium ion battery technology are another GameChanger these batteries are intended to last longer and perform better minimizing the need for Replacements this contributes significantly to the overall lifespan of the Tesla bot every moving part of the bot Tesla's joints gears and Motors has been meticulously designed to withstand years of use this means fewer breakdowns and less need for maintenance allowing the bot to keep working for the Long Haul one more important thing is that Tesla's commitment doesn't end when the bot leaves the factory regular software updates improve improvements and address any issues ensuring your Tesla bot stays in tiptop shape throughout its life the 20-year lifespan of the Tesla B is a careful calculation based on the application of the most advanced technological resources and is the result of persistent research through rigorous testing by Elon and his team in today's Industries many robots are built to last between 10 and 15 years depending on their usage and maintenance for instance robots used in automotive manufacturing one of the most demanding environments often continue to operate effective ly for up to 15 years this is highlighting the potential longevity of highquality robotic systems in addition studies from respected institutions like the robotics Institute provide further backing they found that robots designed with strong durable materials combined with energy efficient systems and advanced automation can go for up to 20 years especially in industrial settings these findings give us a clear indication that with the right design of materials A robot's lifespan can be significantly extended the most concrete evidence comes from Tesla they already demonstrated its ability to extend the life of his products particularly in EVS through regular software updates and robust maintenance systems this same approach is being applied to Tesla bot continuous improvements throughout software updates means that the bot not only maintains its functionality but also improves over time this enables Tesla bot to not only work optimally but also ensure that it never becomes obsolete even if you bought it 20 years ago the design element cannot be ignored in this case Tesla's experience in creating long- lasting Vehicles directly in forms the design of the Tesla buot Tesla cars are expected to last 15 to 20 years thanks to the high quality materials and optimized engineering used in their construction Tesla bought benefits from the same level of craftsmanship and Engineering suggesting that it too is built to last for decades especially one of the key factors in Tesla bot's potential longevity is its battery Tesla spent years developing Advanced Battery Technology for its Vehicles resulting in batteries that last longer and perform better over time and that means Tesla Bots going to have fewer battery Replacements and a longer lifespan before Tesla bot hits the market it undergoes extensive testing including fatigue testing and durability assessments these tests are conducted in harsh conditions such as field tests at gigafactories component and system level tests mechanical and electrical testing and real world learning it ensures the bot can handle continuous operation for years without major hiccups this rigorous approach to testing gives us confidence that Tesla bot is designed to withstand the wear and tear of long-term use for anyone considering Tesla bot this long lifespan represents a solid return on investment and a reliable tool for the future how safe and secure is Tesla bot when talking Tesla bot Safety and Security are at the Forefront of the conversation Tesla's made it clear that they are committed to creating a humanoid robot that not only excels in performance but also prioritizes the safety security and the privacy of its users Tesla's equipped to Tesla bot nextg with an array of advanced safety features these include emergency stop mechanisms obstacle detection and sophisticated navigation systems that allow the bot to operate safely in various environments these systems are designed to prevent accidents and ensure that the bot can work alongside humans without posing a risk in comparison Boston Dynamics robots such as Atlas and spot are also equipped at Advance sensors and AI that enable them to navigate complex environment safely however Boston Dynamics tends to focus more on performance rather than emphasizing user safety to the same degree that Tesla does meanwhile unitri robots like the go1 and go2 include basic safety protocols like obstacle avoidance but they lack the level of sophisticated safety mechanisms that you have in the Tesla bot Tesla's renowned for its strong emphasis on user privacy and data security across its product ecosystem and that goes from Vehicles all the way to Digital Services the Tesla bot NextGen is expected to integrate Advanced encryption secure communication protocols and strict access controls to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access this focus on data security is crucial for users who are concerned about privacy in the age of smart technology in contrast to Boston Dynamics while leading in robot performance has not placed the same emphasis on user data security their robots are primarily designed for commercial and Industrial use where data privacy might not be as big a concern on the other hand unitary they also provide limited info on their data security measures and that could raise concerns for those of us who want privacy Tesla's approach to user control is another area where the Tesla bot stands up Tesla's likely to implement strong authentic iation and authorization mechanisms ensuring that only verified users can access or control the bot remotely and this minimizes the risk of unauthorized remote access which could compromise users or the safety of others Boston Dynamics robots some of which are used in military applications may offer more remote access capabilities which could present greater security risks while unry offers more affordable robots users may have to compromise on personal info security during use priced at around 16 Grand just $4,000 cheap than Tesla bot but the Gap in safety is Major despite the price difference is not so much Tesla's publicly committed to developing AI systems including Tesla bot with strong ethical principles this ethical framework is expected to lead the additional safeguards and oversight to protect user safety and prevent the misuse of the Tesla bot in contrast competing robotics companies like Boston Dynamics and unry have not made the same level of public commitment to ethical AI development this could result in fewer protections for users how does Tesla bot prevent crashes during operation Tesla bot is equipped with numerous redundant Safety Systems including emergency stop mechanisms for sensing joints and advanced sensor arrays these features enable the robot to immediately stop or safely deactivate in case of an unexpected event minimizing the risk of harm in contrast while Boston Dynamics and unitri robots also include safety mechanisms they're not as comprehensive or sophisticated as those found in Tesla bot Tesla's expertise in autonomous vehicle techn technology plays a crucial role in Tesla bot's ability to anticipate proactive accident protection prevents accidents this bot is capable of predicting and proactively responding to potential issues like detecting and avoiding obstacles or mitigating the impact of sudden movements this is a big advantage over Bots than Dynamics in unitri robots which tend to rely more on reactive safety measures that are less effective in fast changing situations Tesla poot has never been inferior to the modern Tesla EVS that consumers have experienced it's outfitted with a wide array of sensors including Imaging and distance sensors allowing it to detect its surroundings and adapt its actions in real time the resolution of Tesla bot similar to Tesla's FSD cameras with a resolution ranging from 1.2 to 1.3 megapixels comparable to cameras and liar sensors used in Atlas and unitary robots which are around 1 to 2 megapixels the field of view of Tesla bot is possibly around 120 to 150¬∞ covering a large surrounding area this is 1.6 times wider than unitary robots which typically have a narrow Earth fov of around 90 to 120¬∞ this level of sensor integration provides Tesla b a significant advantage in maintaining stability and avoiding accidents particularly in complex environments Boston Dynamics Atlas which is also sensor rich is primarily designed for controlled environments and might struggle in more unpredictable settings unitri H1 being lighter and less equipped may find it challenging to handle emergency situations effectively the advanced Control software in test Tesla bot enables quick decision making in emergency scenarios when an issue is detected Tesla bot can swiftly transition to safety mode either slowing down or stopping entirely to protect both itself and its surroundings while Atlas has similar capabilities its response times in critical situations might not be as fast as Tesla bot unitri H1 with its more basic safety protocols might not react as effectively in emergencies potentially increasing the risk of accidents Tesla bot also excels in remote monitoring and control allowing operators to intervene quickly and safely from a distance if necessary this feature enhances the robot's ability to manage unexpected situations in real time reducing the likelihood of crashes in comparison Boston Dynamics and unry robots may not offer the same level of advanced remote control making it harder to respond to sudden issues what is the development plan for the Tesla bot do think we will have Optimus um and limited production in the factory in the actual Factory itself doing useful tasks before the end of this year I think we we may be able to sell it externally by the end of next year as of now Tesla has taken a significant step by beginning the development of custom actuators for Tesla bot Tesla constructed approximately five or six units of Tesla bot these initial units are being fine-tuned to ensure that they meet the high standards required for mass production this phase is crucial as it allows Tesla to identify and resolve any potential issues before scaling and production looking ahead Elon suggested that mass production and delivery of the Tesla bot could start as early as is next year a key milestone in this timeline is the integration of the first actuators by November this sets the stage for a broader roll out the following year this change also reflects the need for additional upgrades such as improved movement enhanced hands speech capabilities and advanced AI but we we expect to have several thousand Optimus robots um produced and doing useful things by the end of next year uh in the tesel factories and then in 2026 wrapping up production quite a bit um and at that point we'll be providing Optimus robots to uh outside customers by 2026 Tesla aims to ramp up production significantly and start mass production and offer Tesla bot robots to external customers making a major expansion of their robotics division Tesla's approach to tesotf uses on the combination of powerful AI within humanoid robot design the company's development process is known for bold claims and high-profile announcements which sometimes lead to skeptic ISM about meeting release dates however Tesla's focus on versatility is consistent with their broader mission in Ai and automation using Tesla bot internally is a strategic move for Tesla it helps perfect the robot's functionality while improving Factor efficiency and reducing labor costs this strategy mirrors Tesla's earlier approach with EVS where initial units were delivered to internal employees before public sales comparison with Boston Dynamics while Tesla's pushing forward with its ambitious plans Boston Dynamics has a different approach Boston Dynamics prioritizes Advanced Dynamic movement capabilities in their robots such as spot and stretch however however boson the Dynamics tends to focus more on specific applications rather than developing a broad general purpose humanoid robot like Tesla Tesla Bots designed with commercialization in mind aimed at mass production with Eline indicating a Target price under $220,000 this contrast with Assa which is primarily a research tool not intended for commercial sale Tesla developed Tesla bot rapidly from conception to functional prototypes in a pretty short time conversely Boston Dynamics often has a slower roll out their robots have longer development Cycles Boston Dynamics has spent years improving Atlas aided by alliances like DARPA to acquire its present degree of dexterity and Mobility the cautious approach contrasts with tesa's more aggressive timeline to ensure Telsa bot is as widely adopted as soon as possible while Atlas demonstrates outstanding athletic abilities like dancing backflipping and vaulting Tesla bot prioritizes practicality in everyday tasks Tesla's Ro robot runs on AI like their cars promising efficiency through a day's work on a single charge in contrast atlas's high-powered hydraulic actuators though powerful limit its operational time due to the battery consumption Tesla bought boasts more human life features including hands with five fingers and opposable thumbs aimed at performing a bunch of different tasks this is part of Tesla's ambition to make robots that closely mimic human capabilities although achieving this level of Dexter ity remains a significant challenge in conclusion depending on the purpose of use the owner will have the most suitable Choice Tesla bot is geared towards affordability and mass production focusing on tasks that can integrate into human environments and workplaces Boston Dynamics Atlas however remains a high performance research platform showing the outer limits of robotic mobility and physical capabilities the real world utility cost Effectiveness and integration into human activities will be crucial factors in comparing these robots performance and impact are you satisfied with Tesla bot's security features and how does its 20-year lifespan fit the needs of

Elon Musk Tesla Robotaxi Hollywood Scam,Chris Norlund,2024-09-04T06:23:32Z,HkLaV2TOCM4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkLaV2TOCM4,"hi friends this is Chris y welcome back to the channel so Elon Musk has got a new scam and he's planning it as we speak so you mean like you knew or just just another issue of the uh well there's always some sort of scam right but it but it's like it's like the plans are in motion so I want to give everyone a fair warning and also get your predictions as well so basically it revolves the robot taxi thing right um they announced the location I don't know a couple days ago it kind of caught brushed under the rug because we were talking about the whole Twitter X Brazil thing right and that which as you guys know this has been absolutely insane but um the new scam we'll talk about we'll talk about Twitter in a minute here is um they're going to do it at Warner Brothers Studio right so basically Hollywood studio they're going to announce this thing and um I I think it's all going to be fake I mean I'm not surprised but the way that they're doing it at a Hollywood studio like making it like a TV show like oh we have flying car they they probably could they probably could I I mean I wouldn't I wouldn't put it past them right you know cuz then they can they can Si you out the wires later and the people pushing the car um the funny thing is is like he's actually done a Hollywood studio announcement before um back when they did Solar City announcement and that ended up being a scam that was on true story guys The Desperate Housewives TV set oh so Elon was a desperate housewive right at that time and he was saying hey we got these great solar panels that was back in 2016 again end up being a scam and so it was very interesting that for his next scam the robot taxi he's doing at another Hollywood set um so basically U why would you do it at this particular place um it's a large like Studio Lot okay cuz I it's you know since they're picking such a big location they probably want to drive it around they're not legal and it looks real yeah if if they if they pick like the back lot or if they pick some sort of you know advertising it looks really good oh sure sure sure if if you pick the right set and you set it up right yeah it may actually look like your neighborhood so that part's kind of interesting right so they're kind of shooting like like a commercial shoot yeah in a way right but but the thing why and I want to point this out why it's why the the demonstration will be a little bit deceptive there was like a hacker person and they were sharing some data that Tesla is already sort of mapping out the area around the studio like extremely well cuz this is something that we've known about with their robotex before is like uh Elon Musk and the YouTubers who used their um that's the full driving thing they have a better experience than the regular person oh because the engineers like spend all their time making sure that like that area is mapped out and then also putting like kind of um I would to say like like like barriers or invisible walls like a track kind of thing so they're doing at a at a Hollywood studio it's not a realistic environment they're not street legal and they're trying to convince you that this thing works um the reason why I saying it's well I mean there minwise a scam but but one thing that t always does is they like push the stuff out to that's not ready and they pretend like it is yeah so actually Hyundai has a you know they're working on same technology but they still working on it maybe it will finish by next year well we're talking about a couple different things though okay so CU mentioned that Hyundai's got technology also right so there's two different there's two separate Technologies so one is basically the taxi type technology the other which Hyundai's working on and we saw we saw a demo of the thing we actually saw it right um the other one is the parking thing parking one yeah and so Tesla and this is I guess had another scam um Tesla saying hey guys we got this thing he's calling it ass or ass yeah I know it's it's it's a stupid thing most companies call it um you don't want to name your tech technology I guess evid El wants to name his technology as I think it means for auto summon service or something like that yeah even have that but I don't want yeah I name it ass U most other companies they call it auto valet valet S A little better but the basic just why I say it's kind of a scam and be careful on this thing again this stuff's not street legal you have a car that's driving around with no driver in it and so the way they get around it and all the Tesla stock promoters have been doing it is like hey guys go to like a Walmart parking lot or like a Costco parking lot and like I don't want to and like play with your car in the parking lot and I mean the problem is is like you're encouraging people to test this in public right yeah I mean it's private property but you're still in public and there could be kids running around or any kind of thing you know so and and I want to get your guys's thoughts on that so you know what do you what do you think about testing a beta technology with basically amateurs right these aren't you know professional and plus it's working only on those kind of Environ maybe not your neighborhood well cuz it has a line you know right okay that that's another point right yeah cuz cuz we talked about before in the channel the way the the tesas robot or self-driving thing is it needs lines to operate right if there's no lines the thing does very very poorly and that's something yeah yeah that that's actually a really good point yeah that yeah I saw the hyai know demonstrate their parking you the the auto auto parking so you push the number of the sh shopping mall you know the number it goes to there you understand it comes to you I see so we're talking about in terms of like how could you get this to work yeah so so I'm not against this technology right I'm I'm not I'm not against it I'm against like giving it to the public just to distest just makes Mak it works yeah you don't want to put stuff on the road that can hurt people but technology wise yeah I like I love that well okay in order to get in order to get any of this kind of stuff to work I think we all have to have it or none of us has it yep right so like like for example just for example let's say we all go to the shopping mall we get out of our car right and then you push the the number of the parking spot and everything drives like crazy crazy super slow and then you you go there but there is one caveat though so Tesla's technology is going to be different than H it's going to be inferior and I know the Tesla fan Boyles get that but it's just reality the hardware in the Teslas is camera only only camera no sensor no sensors yeah um because it it's too expensive to put in sensors so they they take it out and then they pretend like oh we don't need sensors it's just a cut cost right um because the problem with with if if you only go camera only if there's no lines anywhere it's no good right U if the camera gets dirty it's no good uh if the weather's raining snowing whatever again mult reasons it's it's no good so that's why you want you want sensors if if you had enough money you could put a ton of sensors in these things it work a lot better but then you know it might cost you $200,000 and it's it's not really practical right so I'm not I'm not completely against the parking stuff um but you know whether or not you know we get to the point to where everyone has it and and it's safe uh cuz one of the issues that's going to happen when you have a new technology and someone dies which is going to invariably happen at some point law after that yeah there'll be laws people like why did you let these things on the road you know people are going to be upset that that kind of stuff so I I think that's something that that's a big concern the other issue is going to be Insurance costs right uh someone in our community CU we have a really smart Community they said you will know when this technology is ready to when you put insurance on your car and the insurance companies option what's that there's option okay well one would be that option that there's for that right but the other one would be that the option would be like the insurance companies sort of rate it to where it's it's safer I see so so I give you a simple example so um for those you have car insurance you know this um if your car has like a like an auto tracking thing you can say my car comes with a Tracker and if someone seals it I I can track my car easier right so the insurance is like oh you got a Tracker we lower your insurance if if you tell the insurance company I have you know robot driving or whatever and the insurance company says that's a good thing and they lower your value right do you understand yeah that that that's based on statistics based on numbers if the insurance companies believe that the robots are safer and and they include that in policy I see right do you see what I'm saying then then then then we're ready for it yeah yeah yeah we're we're a long we're a long ways from that right you know these days if you tell insurance company you have it they they might raise it because too many people get hurt cuz they play with it the same way that the people playing with their you know ass system in the in the Costco in the Costco parking lot or you know and then that's why I go back to like Tesla's going to announce their their robot texi thing at the um what do you want to call it at the uh at at the the movie studio right so so it's a big problem the other thing we got to talk about is the Twitter situation so now just back to Twitter not a yeah I I showed y Ela must feed we usually don't look at it cuz it's just too much right yeah but one of the things he's like hey everyone in community do you still call it Twitter or X it's like stupid well the problem was actually I thought I thought the Twitter with like the bird logo and then and I send out tweets I thought that was a pretty good logo and a pretty good branding right so now like when you have X am I sending out X's I mean it's kind of weird to to say that right I don't I don't think anyone really knows cuz we still refer to his Twitter and and tweets yeah so you know whether or not they change it back that would be a really really interesting thing um they spent a bunch of money already yeah to to change the brand to change the brand you got to you know change the stationary and they they made like a new sign for the building sign new memo and new paper back yeah so but what would you do you made the mistake of changing from Twitter to X and so if you change it back everyone's going to make fun of you right he doesn't care right right I that's musy doesn't care so would you just change your back then I guess because it's better it is better I don't know he maybe people voting for tater he said oh I'm gonna you know follow you guys and you I'll bring you back to the trer the problem is whatever vote that he does it's always a fake vote anyway cuz he can have a bunch of bots vote on vote on said boat actually it's really funny you know Mark Cuban the um he's the guy on the the shk tank guy yeah yeah so he's in a he's in a fight with the they always figh about stupid stuff but um Mark cubin did a poll of like who do you think is going to win for president you knower Trump and then like the robotss all voted for Trump right and um Cuban pointed out he's like hey I have like 500,000 Impressions so Impressions like how many people see your post or whatever but then like a million people voted on the thing you see what I'm saying like it doesn't add up yeah that's right and and so then and then Mark T's like how many Bots do you have on this on on this platform so I mean I can just tell you guys I have an account on Twitter ask what you want to call it um I don't tweet anything I just use it just to to check on you know whatever people are doing I have like 80 robot followers and they're all hot girls and they all want to cuddle and every day there's like a new follower and the other thing that's kind of funny is um whatever you follow certain accounts there'll be like three copies of that account that follow you so not the it's just it's just filled with bots so you have you have that problem and then we Lo we looked at the feed they got a working on that what's that theer a well some of these even are um blue check marks yeah yeah so so that so that means like someone is paying to have a robot yeah yeah yeah right so there's been there's been question of like who's who's putting up the money to do it or is Elon mus just giving a bunch of robots blue check I mean I don't know they're not going to tell you right who knows I mean they they tell you a kind of crazy number they they always um it's his CEO CU I mean he's not actually the CEO cuz he stepped down but leis know she she released numbers recently and she's like guys we have like 30% Republican 30% Democrat 30% independent like that's what they said and I was just like how do you know because when you sign up for you know an account there you don't tell them you know which party you're in you don't you don't really know and plus they're all robots anyway so it it's it's it's really hard to say how many people real people are not real people are on there I mean I mean I don't think anybody really know and then and it's funny too because um uh from Elon mus point of view as long as he's got traffic as long as people are are or someone is paying him or whatever right you just don't know um and then then we looked at it and it's like remember the The Wall Street Journal said there was like 61 tweets a day right um we looked at it's real it's like like nonstop and and the recent one was was the big one was um he had tweeted out this weird thing where like Only You Know Rich white people oh men Rich right men you know should be able to vote yeah like like I mean I mean like well remember musk was born during a part in South Africa which is which is basically where know there his grandpa is super racist right yeah yeah and I made a video guys about that I I wish I was making that stuff up I I can't even repeat the stuff that his grandfather said uh cuz his actually his grandfather wrote a couple conspiracy theory books um his grandfather was against vaccines he was against all kinds of stuff he blamed it let just say this he get along with a certain group of people in Germany in 1940s cuz grandfather was it was that kind of conspiracy kind of person and then the stuff that he he'd write about um CU there's actually newspaper articles you can find it it's easy to find it's all public um he'd basically write about like you know I'm the owner of the plantation and my workers who have to be a certain kind of people you know and like I said it's it's kind of what You' expect from that kind of stuff so I can't I can't repeat this stuff so even though Elon mus didn't really know his grandfather I'm just to be honest he didn't really know his grandfather I guess uh his grandfather uh died when Elon was three Elon comes from just those kind of family that kind of family yeah yeah so you know one of the things that they all now he's saying those kind of things yeah yeah if he didn't say those kind of things then you you know you know you you know you don't have to be like your grandfather you don't have to be weird like your father um did I tell you about his father no his father had two kids oh yeah you're with his with stepter step but it's it's I know it sounds weird it's the father's has a stepdaughter and then the father has two kids with a step so basically I think what it was is like elon's Dad married some woman the woman had a daughter and then the dad like the daughter yeah divorc it with the mom and then has two kids with a daughter it's it's weird so but again like like like if Elon doesn't have Elon doesn't have to be like that but I mean you know Elon has like 12 kids with all sorts of people so anyway that's the Elon stuff I just wanted to share the latest scam with the robot taxi we talked about the um the parking driving thing I want to hear what your guys' thoughts on that and what do you think about the latest crazy stuff that Y is saying on Twitter anyway thanks for watching everyone and uh we'll catch you in the next video so bye"

Brazil X ban: Elon Musk&#39;s platform will stay blocked | LiveNOW from FOX,LiveNOW from FOX,2024-09-04T04:33:25Z,034W7A20SuI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=034W7A20SuI,"minutes. And welcome back here at 2 live. Now. From Fox. I'm Andrew craft. We want to get into more of these top headlines here. Uh, brought you just yesterday, Remember, we were reporting. uh that a Brazilian. Supreme a Brazilian yesterday. unanimously upheld the decision. of 1 of its justices. to block billionaire, Elon Musk, social media platform, X, Nationwide there in the South American country. Fox News correspondent Griff Jenkins, has more The social media. line in 1 of South America's largest countries. Brazil Supreme Court, unanimously, upheld a ban of the site X by its top judge on Monday. the ruling blocks access Nationwide for some mandates. X founder Elon Musk. paid more than dollars in fines in nominate illegal Representative within the country. I don't know how far we can go. It's strange, how far we're getting in terms of information. and the limitations, They're trying to put on the population. the Court's top judge Alexander de moraes suspended X last week claiming it allows the spread of misinformation He also said a daily fine of nearly. $9,000 for anyone using virtual private networks to access the platform? musk said the ruling is destroying free speech. Adding the current Brazilian Administration. likes to wear the cloak of crushing the People under its boot Brazil's president issuing this warning To sit down. of money. does not allow you to disrespect it. He is not a citizen of the world. can't defend presidents, congressmen, The senate or the Supreme Court. in addition to the ban on X. the court has also Frozen satellite internet provider starlinks Financial accounts in Brazil which is owned by mosque and all of this could have an impact on. fans traveling to the Eagles Packers. season opening game. set for this Friday. in Brazil. in Washington. Griff Jenkins. so much. as always and the meantime we do want to bring into the conversation our friend at the Manhattan Institute. Daniel D. Martino he joins us. Uh, Daniel good to see you again. Uh, I would definitely wanted to get you on about this story. Uh, you're somewhat of our unofficial Latin American correspondent here. This is big though, in Brazil. Um, wrong. Let's parse through the noise of the story if you are an everyday, Brazilian, right now. and you have Twitter on your it, right? Correct, you cannot use it unless you have a VPN. uh, which you could like that, it would be physically possible to use a VPN and illegal and you risk a large finding the government finds out. okay, so as of now after this, ruling yesterday and panel of the Supreme Court in Brazil, it wasn't the entire Brazilian Supreme Court. It upheld this. and that panel was unanimous here. What does that say forward? will we see access to X anytime soon? Well, but no notice what is going on here. Um, I Anytime soon, in Brazil, but notice that this is all about the politics. So that people understand why is exas suspended because some judges in the Brazilian Supreme Court, thought that the whole social media must be suspended. If Elon Musk does not eliminate certain candidates, and members of Congress, in Brazil, including, uh, former president Bose sonar because they're claiming that they're spreading some sort and look, I'm not sure if the claims are valid or not, but Elon Musk is not there to police. speech over. What's true? And actually introduced the whole context notes on on Twitter on X recently, Uh, so to add context, um, I I feel like it's very much you see, who are the members of this panel that includes somebody who was a member of the Communist Party of Brazil, that includes people who were part of the government. of of Lula in the past, These are not independent Supreme Court Justices. This is a formerly politicians. Okay. Because that's what I was going to ask you if this is purely political and that's what it seems like you're getting out here. Who is this? very controversial Figure 1 of the judges on the Supreme Court by the name of Alexander de moraes. Um how influential is he in Brazil? and does he just have an axe to grind against bolsonaro here? He is quite controversial. Why? well, he's controversial because of of not just this action but everything that Brazilian Supreme Court has been doing in the past 6 months. which is putting jail. Uh and and and forbid for running from for office People who who? he said have spread lights about the election. banned from running for for president again, even though his constitutionally allowed by the Supreme Court. X is the next step. First, they went after they're going after the whole population who opposes them. and, you know, think about it from the US perspective. This is an American company, right? That is probably owned by an American citizen living here. uh, they're trying to take over his assets in Brazil, not just access as you mentioned, It's also Space X assets because they're owned by VA musk. So now they're just going after him directly not not after the whole truth of what the election. Um, if x it was smart about its whole legal setting, I'm not sure what it's legal. Uh, uh settlement is like, in in Brazil and in other countries, but if they can get arbitration inside you as Quartz. Brazil is in a lot of trouble because American companies have a very good record of seizing. foreign government Assets in the US, if they acting correctly in their home countries. Yes, we just saw that. Of course recently with the maduro's private plane from Venezuela. Um but but to your point Brazilians, at least on the Judiciary. uh, you know, alleging these acts against us going after. his company X going after his company starlink here, where's the check? On expert on the Brazilian Judiciary System here or Brazilian judicial philosophy But is there a check or not? Well, the only check that could happen now is if Congress decides to impeach and remove the Brazilian Supreme Court Justices, which is a check very similar to the 1 in the US Constitution. But obviously it's a high threshold, a high bar that is unlikely to to happen given the current composition of Congress. But the the move to suspend next certainly puts uh, uh the moras in the spot at least because everybody including leftist in Brazil are upset that they cannot access social media. It's 40 million in Brazilians that have a population of what 150 million eligible voters. So it's nearly we're talking about over a quarter, nearly a third of illegible voters who cannot access the social media That that is a problem. and I don't think that Lula calculated really well. What? What was happening? Just for our viewers, though, and to hammer the point, um, because I myself have somewhat struggling with the, the rationale underpinning. This action but by the Brazilian Supreme Court, is it purely over? Posts that have appeared on social media. on the platform X in Brazil. You know, questioning the institutions that be there. like the 2020 election where bolsar lost, uh, and you can make similarities to what happened after 2020. in Brazil and after 2020 in the United States we won't do that here. We don't have the time but is that it yeah, that that's literally it. It is all because Twitter refused to people who were the Supreme Court doesn't like there was no threat of violence. Uh, we're not talking about uh, you know illegal activities. Uh musk has been very clear that he would just spend anything that is illegal. uh, we're we're talking about uh, just speech free speech. Uh, and by the way, bonaro didn't even like call for anything during the after he lost the election. This was all by, by other politicians. bosar himself, admitted his own defeat in the election. Even if he said there was fraud he said he the Luda was elected. So uh like this is really a very authoritarian move. and why a lot of people are saying that Brazil is going in a really bad Direction. okay? So Daniel uh, according to the associated Press, the platform has clashed with demaray over its reluctance. to block users. And has alleged that they may raise once an in-country legal representative. So that Brazilian authorities can exert leverage over the company by having someone. To arrest. Do you anticipate that? X? Would. accommodate that request, sending. to Brazil. and in country representative that can Hammer all of this out with the powers that be or know or or do you buy? X and musk's? claim that they just want someone there to blame in Brazil representing X. Well, I just don't see any reason why X would you know, put somebody in a vulnerable position to get arrested. in necessarily like what are they going to do to mask? That's the question. They're going to seize a few million dollars that this man who has billions. uh in the United States. That's the United States. hurt Elon Musk. It's only going to hurt Brazilians, right? We're going to lose. access to Starling who are going to lose access to 2x. That's not going to hurt Elon Musk, that's going to hurt them. And so, um, I don't think Brazil has the upper hand here and that's what they don't understand. Okay. Um you know, Daniel I'm very circumspect about the term censorship. uh, here on live now I think it's a word that is used a lot lately and the effect. of that over usage. seems to be the dilution of the meaning of the word. But is that what we're seeing here in Brazil Can we say the c word? I, I would 100%. call this censorship. Uh, and in fact, censorship is just having band X censorship is also what they were requesting. X. dose and that they refused to do. We're not talking any, you know? I'm, I think that you're right about, We have to be very careful about using this word when it's not the case. Uh, you may disagree, you may agree. with both sonaro but why are you suspending a whole social media? That's like saying we should spend Facebook because Trump said that the 2020 election was stolen. That's the equivalent imagine if the US government the FCC or the Supreme Court to spend their Facebook Nationwide because of something Trump said it would be ridiculous, right? And that's what's happening in Brazil, Okay. Um, Daniel 1, interesting note though. going to Brazil later this week on Friday. the Packers and the Eagles. are playing in Rio. I want to put this up here. uh because we're transitioning totally to professional sports right now. Uh, Chris o Connell our friend there at Fox 29 of Philadelphia. posted this statement there from a Wisconsin State lawmaker who was asking the NFL to move the Eagles Packers game out of Brazil. because of quote unquote, widespread unrest? and escalating violence. Uh, that is from Moe. There In Wisconsin. saying, in light of the current political and social climate in Brazil, I urge the NFL in Green Bay Packers to reconsider the upcoming game. Scheduled to be held in Brazil, Friday, the alarming reports of widespread unrest escalating violence and profound censorship against us companies operating within Brazil. paying a troubling picture of the conditions there that reads in the first paragraph now. you know the, uh question about the Supreme Court there and Elon Musk and X. um, is it safe for an American professional? sports League to play a game in Rio? uh, well I would argue it is it is safe, okay? But I do think that it is a fair thing to say that the US government uh should put pressure on Brazil to to not do what they're doing because at the end, they are indeed harming American interests of an important American company. of an American person. they're doing it. Unfairly they are certainly violating the rights of their own citizens to free speech. And and you know, just putting a little leverage there and saying that the NFL shouldn't host a game. I think that's totally fair play, okay? I want to correct Eagles game. essay Paulo. it's not in Rio, it's in South.
