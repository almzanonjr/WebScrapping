you're watching vantage with me py Sharma [Music] [Music] Israel is witnessing Mass protest thousands of people are out on the streets they're angry with their prime minister after six more Israeli hostages were found dead in Gaza the people say he's putting his political survival above the lives of citizens the US meanwhile is finalizing a ceasefire deal will Netanyahu take it we'll discuss in Brazil X has been banned after Elon Musk picked a battle with the country Supreme Court he says he's fighting for free speech we'd like to see him do that that in China where Tesla has big business

the China Africa Forum this week it will be beijing's biggest diplomatic event since the covid pandemic China wants to deepen its ties with the resourcer continent of Africa Beijing is Africa's largest trading partner and Sweden tells parents that toddlers should not be allowed to watch screens at all asking parents to keep children under the age of two away from digital media and television the Swedish government is also mulling a ban on smartphones in primary [Music] schools we are just waiting for so many days [Music] [Applause] Israel as you can see is up in arms the people are angry and out on the streets because of the news they got over the weekend six more Israeli hostages found dead in Gaza for many Israeli citizens these deaths were a Tipping Point so they stepped out of their homes in the thousands to protest against their government most of these people are blaming one man for the hostage debts their prime minister Benin Netanyahu there is widespread anger against him and his security forces are facing the brunt of it [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] these clashes happened last night crowds broke through police lines they blocked a major highway some protesters set fires on the road among them were families of the hostages for months they have been criticizing prime minister Netanyahu accusing him of ignoring the safety of hostages and prioritizing his political survival we are here to protest against the Israeli government uh that is making wrong decisions this government because of political reasons and for the right extreme Coalition of Netanyahu is breaking those values and this is the core of the existence of our country no values no country that's why we're here to save the country to bring back the hostages I think we have a criminal government criminal government who lets the hostages be murdered only for the sake of the Coalition and we have a prime minister who doesn't think of the good of a country but only of of of his his own good the protest continued today as well workers and trade unions went on a strike so government and municipal offices private schools businesses even the Ben guran airport in telie were all shut today doctors to join the strike they walked out of Duty we are striking it's a very hard word for physician who are here to take care for the life and the well-being of the our patient but H we are in a very very hard situation now we and all the country because of the hostages we can stand aside and that's why we came into a strike in Tel Aviv a huge crowd gathered outside the defense Ministry all these protesters have two Demands a ceasefire deal in Gaza and the return of all remaining hostages that is what they want crowds also gathered at the funeral of one of the hostages who died in Gaza [Music] the strike was supposed to end at 600 p.m. local time but Israel's labor Court intervene that's because the government moved Court it filed an injunction against the strike and the court termed the strike as political it ordered the unions to end the strike in the afternoon but this order applied only to the union workers it was just for them thousands of other Israeli citizens were still out on the streets from all walks of life voicing the same demand get the hostages back in some places there were fresh clashes today [Music] so how many hostages are still there in Gaza now an exact figure is not available more than 200 people were captured in October last year that's when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th they took more than 200 hostages some were returned a lot of them died Reports say 97 hostages still remain unaccounted for and it's hard to get an accurate number now because the fighting is still on it continues despite the protests Israel is still pounding Gaza today they targeted a school it was being used as a shelter for displac Palestinians the Israeli forces Struck it at least 11 people were killed these military actions are becoming harder to justify for prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu especially after what happened over the weekend Israeli forces were on a mission they were searching for hostages in southern Gaza during this operation they found the dead bodies these six hostages were already dead before the Israeli forces arrived as usual a bitter Blame Game followed Israel says Hamas killed these six hostages Hamas says Israeli gunfire killed them an American citizen was among the victims his name is her Goldberg poin he had dual citizenship of Israel and the US his death has prompted reactions from Washington DC President Joe Biden issued a statement it said Hamas will pay for this at the same time the US is working on a deal the Americans have been talking to Egypt and qar together they are crafting a new ceasefire deal or take it or leave it to offer for Israel and what will be the terms of this deal a ceasefire in Gaza and an exchange proposal Hamas could be asked to release the remaining hostages they took from Israel in return Israel will have to give up Palestinian prisoners now for months both sides have been going back and forth over this but now the US hopes that mounting public pressure will force Netanyahu to accept this time it's not a given though Netanyahu is yet to commit he has called today's strike shameful that's the word he used he says the protest will strengthen the hand of Hamas you see this war has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians but it's the death of six Israeli hostages that may finally Force Nan's hand which says a lot about how human life is valued in this conflict Brazil has banned X it's a sort of decision that would make the front page but in most places it hasn't because the ban was largely expected you see Elon Musk had picked a fight in Brazil his Target a judge of the Brazilian Supreme Court the judge asked X to block certain accounts on the platform most of them linked to farri right parties these accounts were accused of spreading fake news so the judge asked X to block these accounts but Elon Musk refused he resorted to personal attacks on the judge he compared him to Darth Vader even called him an unelected dictator that was his first mistake the second mistake came last week Brazilian laws required social media companies to appoint a legal representative again Elon Musk refused so the court had no choice it has asked Apple and Google to remove X from their App Stores of course you can still use VPN but if you're caught using VPN and on X the fine is stiff around $88,000 per day that is the fine so X has effectively been banned in Brazil now this issue can be polarizing a ban is rarely the answer to any problem especially when free speech is involved but Elon Musk is also responsible here maybe he finds the Judgment unfair in which case he can always use legal means he can disagree and still respect the law of the land that's what normal businesses would do but not Elon Musk he chooses to insult and abuse off his bearers look at his latest post musk says the Supreme Court judge meddled in Brazil's last election has he offered any evidence of course not instead he's asking followers with evidence to reply reply to his post it is childish it is dangerous but it's not unprecedented Elon Musk has made a habit of this in Australia he sparred with prime minister antthony albanesi in the UK he sparred with prime minister K starma he said a civil war is inevitable in the UK do you see the problem here Elon Musk is not just a normal ex-user he's the richest person on the planet also the most followed account on X he's got 196 million followers so his words and tweets carry weight but musk is not using that power wisely he's using it to bully and fight foreign governments it's a sign of how how far X has fallen Elon Musk bought the platform he bought Twitter for $44 billion today the platform is worth around half of that so nearly $22 billion wiped out same with advertisers out of the top 1,000 advertisers half have left X the reason Elon Musk he was asked about advertisers leaving the platform his response was to abuse them musk has fired nearly 80% of all EX employees that includes content regulation teams as well the guys who filter out hate and fake news he's fired all of them as a result X is now more toxic and advertising companies had a problem with this they said their ads were being displayed alongside Neo-Nazi tweets so what did they do they pulled out now all of this makes one thing pretty clear Elon musk is running x to the ground and he's now lost a key Market Brazil had around 24 million x users it was the fourth biggest market for the company and that has disappeared overnight all thanks to Elon Musk and his refusal to play by the rules I know Elon Fanboys won't like this they think he's God or something but do remember this you may like his Brash attitude when he's on your side but he won't always be he can always turn his attention to your country or your political group and when he does that you will think differently of course there are exceptions here have you ever heard Elon Musk criticize China or Saudi Arabia chances are you haven't because he's not done it China is the biggest electric vehicle Market in the world they make more than half of elon's Teslas so he's mom on Beijing in fact he pushes Chinese propaganda last year he said Taiwan is an integral part of China same with Saudi Arabia Riyad used to own around 5% of Tesla a Saudi Prince was also part of his takeover of X so clearly Elon musk's Free Speech advocacy has a red line and that red line is money and I know we've only talked about X but these problems apply to most American social media Giants they still don't respect local laws when other platforms do it they get punished when American platforms do it they get away just look at telegram its CEO was arrested by France last week why because Telegram was used by organized crime groups same with Tik Tok Western countries have curbed its use they say Tik Tok is working for the Chinese regime fair enough it's a fair point but where is the action against X or Instagram or Facebook Facebook was implicated in the rohinga genocide in Myanmar the platform Amplified anti- ringia hate was Mark Zuckerberg arrested for that no he wasn't no one battered an eyelid say same with child abuse around 100,000 children 100,000 children were sexually harassed on Facebook and Instagram in 2021 did Mark Zuckerberg face any consequences well he was grilled by the US Senate but after that nothing happened it tells you about the double standard US social media companies are subservient at home but they're Rogue abroad they ignore hateful content they pick fights with governments and they refuse to follow local laws so to all the Elon Bros out there we have just one thing to say don't let American corporations decide your free speech you have laws and courts to do exactly that now Pakistan desperately needs funds it is on the hook for billions and the bills are piling up you could say none of this is news this has been the Pakistan story for a while now what's new is this they have a new payment to make a demand from from Iran more like an ultimatum you see Pakistan had a deal with Iran they've committed to building a gas pipeline but they haven't built it yet and Iran is done waiting the Iranians say either complete the project or pay a penalty a whopping $18 billion that's what Iran wants Pakistan to pay $8 billion obviously Pakistan does not have that kind of money so can they finish the project like I said it's a gas pipeline the deal was signed way back in 2010 Pakistan and Iran called it the peace pipeline it was supposed to run from the Iranian border to Pakistan's guad Port that's a distance of over 19900 km more than 1100 km of this pipeline was supposed to be on the Iranian side and more than 700 kilm in Pakistan and it would have been a boon for Islamabad their country would have benefited immensely from the project it would have boosted their energy security the pipeline was supposed to supply up to a billion cubic feet of gas per day this volume of gas can power up to 30 million homes a day now the tenure of this pack was 25 years 14 of those years are already over and Pakistan is still sitting on it it is yet to build the pipeline Iran has done its bid though their side of the project is done they're ready to export the gas and they've invested heavily in this pipeline at least $2 billion so far that's what Iran has invested but Pakistan has not delivered on its part it hasn't even completed the groundwork the pipeline like I told you was supposed to be built in guad according to the Pakistani press they're yet to acquire the land for this project now you may ask why why is Islamabad dragging its feet well they blame all of it on us sanctions and for a change they may have a point the US has play placed sanctions on Iran over the Iranian nuclear program it has kept Iran out of the international banking system so if Pakistan Imports energy from Iran if Pakistan buys gas from Iran it will end up violating American sanctions what's worse it could be slapped with American sanctions needless to say Pakistan cannot afford that and they will not risk it but this is not the only reason they've been lagging behind Pakistan has made multiple flip-flops on this matter in the month of March this year they said they don't need a waiver that Pakistan does not need a waiver from the us to construct the pipeline that's what their foreign minister said foreign Ministry said but within a few days they changed their tune Pakistan's petroleum Minister said they would seek a waiver for the project after all in fact he said and I'm quoting they would plead Pakistan's case vigorously these flip-flops seem to have upset Iran in 2014 they had granted a 10 year extension to Pakistan that extension will expire this month so now Iran has sent a final notice to Islamabad their message is quite simple build the pipeline or we'll see you in court and what happens if Pakistan does not comply well Iran could move the international Court of arbitration the court could impose penalties on Pakistan if Pakistan loses this case they could be asked to pay up to $8 billion this is money that Islamabad does not have $18 billion it was bailed out by the IMF earlier this year remember it's the international monetary fund the lender of Last Resort and that bailout was not enough so Pakistan is lobbying with the IMF again for a larger and longer bailout although that wouldn't stop Iran from seeking damages Pakistan is also a repeat offender in 2019 an Australian mining company took Pakistan to court over an exploration contract the company had invested in a copper mining project the international Court of arbitration heard the case they found Pakistan guilty they imposed a fine of $6 billion Pakistan later settled the case out of court and they still ended up paying $1 billion to the Australian company Pakistan also has energy bills to pay it owes some $15 billion to Chinese companies those bills are still unpaid those power bills to China again Islamabad does not have the money to settle them in July it reached out to China with a request it wants this debt to be restructured what does that tell you if the Chinese can't get Pakistan to pay we say good luck to Iran the peace pipeline should serve as a cautionary tail Pakistan is a Serial defaulter and it is broke Iran's pipeline looks like a pipe dream and staying with Pakistan let's tell you about what's what was supposed to be Pakistan's biggest thrift store the the dream Bazar in Karachi it opened around 300 p.m. local time and within half an hour the mall was empty the goods were all gone now you would imagine the opening was a super hit but then again this is Pakistan the mall was empty because of an out of control mob that looted it they vandalized it they broke the glasses beat up the security personnel and took all the goods home how did karachi's dream turn into such a nightmare our our next report tells you [Music] hello [Music] it was supposed to be a grand opening yet it turned into absolute chaos this is dream Bazaar it's located in the city of Karachi in Pakistan according to reports it was established by a Pakistani businessman living abroad the mall was marketed as Pakistan's first Mega Thrift Store and the promises were lofty apparently you could buy anything for as less as 50 Pakistani Rupees that's around 18 the opening day was on Friday the store announced special discounts there were aggressive marketing campaigns it was set to be a grand Affair dream Bazar opened at around 3:00 p.m. local time but by 3:30 p.m. it was completely looted thousands gathered outside the mall ahead of the opening when the gates opened they rushed in the crowd swelled every minute the mall management tried to keep things under control but soon it was impossible and things descended into chaos people looted the entire store they took whatever they saw some carried them out in their arms While others brought back bags to stuff goods and carry them home meanwhile the security there was overwhelmed the crowd overpowered them they beat up the security Personnel glasses were shattered the property was [Applause] destroyed some people even filmed themselves while vandalizing the store outside the mall things came to a standstill traffic stopped and people gathered but where were the police well they were nowhere to be seen some alleged the police ignored the looters and were beating up bystanders instead of course the incident has since divided Pakistani social media some called it a Banana Republic others lamented the lack of rules or ethics but more importantly it's a commentary on the country itself and its economy take Karachi for example it's where the mall is located Karachi accounts for 25% of Pakistan's GDP it generates 50% of the country's Revenue yet development projects in the city are missing the government slashed the budget for that so what's the government doing about it well it's touting its own record a few days ago Pakistan prime minister shabbaz Sharif spoke on the economy he said the country is moving towards stability yet the numbers don't look good debt has soared to $254 billion this comes as Pakistan is anxiously awaiting a $7 billion bailout from the international monetary fund meanwhile the people of Pakistan are struggling inflation is still high things remain unaffordable and The Angst is palpable the Looting and vandalism in Karachi reflected this the mall may have started out as a dream project but Pakistan's dream Bazar turned out to be a big nightmare back now let's turn our attention to Southeast Asia a clash took place over the weekend a maritime clash between the Philippines in China in the west Philippine Sea that's the part of the sea that belongs to the Philippines therefore it's called the West Philippine Sea but China claims the entire region as its own and it tries to enforce these fantasies with aggression on Saturday this happened again multiple Chinese ships ganged up on a Philippine Coast Guard vessel then one of the Chinese boats rammed into it Thrice take a [Music] look Sailors on board the Filipino vessel recorded the attack they say that the Chinese ship deliberate ramped into them and that's certainly what it looks like the Filipino ship was damaged there are now holes in the ship's Hull you can see the aftermath but despite this Visual Evidence China is trying to turn this around Beijing claims to be the real victim of the Clash they released their own video of the incident taken by someone on board the Chinese vessel this video shows just one of the three ramming incidents and Beijing is trying to portray it as an aggressive maneuver by the Philippines today a Chinese spokesperson doubled down on this claim first of all the Sabina sh is part of China's nansa Islands on August 31st a Philippine Coast Guard vessel had illegally stayed in the waters near sabinaa Sho for a long time in an unprofessional and dangerous way it deliberately rammed into a Chinese Coast Guard vessel defending what is its rightful position this caused a collision between the vessels from both the Chinese and Filipino sides it is therefore justifiable that China takes necessary measures in accordance with the law which is legitimate lawful and Beyond reproach you've seen both the videos both the versions the Chinese and the Philippine 01 I'll let you decide who looks like the aggressor meanwhile let's look at a bigger picture here this was the fifth clash between China and the Philippines in a month the fifth clash in one month Chinese ships and planes constantly butt head with Filipino vessels hoping to take hold of the disputed region by force so let's understand the situation a bit better first why is this area disputed let's show you the map this is where the Sabina SCH is located it's about 230 kilomet away from Palawan one of the islands that make up the Philippines now according to International maritime law anything up to 370 km away from the coast falls into a country exclusive economic zone EZ anything that's 370 km away from the land border is your EZ the sabinaa sh is 230 km away from the Philippines so it is well within its territory then why does China have ships in the area why is it clashing with the Philippines over this island well because it's China China believes itself to be above international law it keeps pooing bogus territorial claims based on Ancient Imperial boundaries using these convenient old Maps Beijing claims almost the entire South China SE region it draws this Infamous this Infamous n-h line and it claims everything within this n-h line obviously that is bogus an international tribunal said as much it ruled against the Chinese claims back in 2016 so the dispute should have been over but China refused to accept the verdict it continues to harass countries that should actually control the region and that is why a dispute still exists now let's look at the reason behind all of this why does China want this area so badly why does it want to control the entire South China Sea region the simple answer is resources the entire sea is rich in oil and gas new deposits keep getting discovered it should be enough to benefit all the countries in the region but China wants to hold all of it and it's not just oil and gas you also have fish the South China Sea region is full of marine life it's a boon for the for a nation's food security but again China wants to hog it all it keeps sending its trollers to exploit the region even areas in the exclusive economic zones or ezed of other nations so China is literally stealing food off Filipino plates that's one reason why it wants to control the South China Sea for the resources the second reason is trade about $3 trillion worth of trade flows through the region every year $3 trillion it's more than the GDP of most countries and then there's the Strategic angle remember Beijing views the South China Sea region as its own as its mythical historical territory so it wants to control the region to the te China has set up a number of military bases and air strips all over the sea which it can use to exert pressure on other nations and counter any challenges so the region is lucrative and it has milit value no wonder Beijing goes to such lengths to exert control our next story is from Germany an election took place there yesterday in two German states Saxony and turingia now these were state level elections they won't change the country's top leadership but the results made Global headlines because an unlikely Force ended up the winner the AAR right part called alternative for Germany or afd that's the party afd it won the state of turingia and it came second a very close second in Saxony and this seems to have alarmed the world because it's a first since the second world war the first time since the second world war that a farri party has won elections in Germany the last far-right party to do so was it was the Nazi party yes those Nazis so you can understand the discomfort and you can decide for yourself if it is warranted here's the co- leader of the afd giving a glimpse of the party's politics our school classes are being flooded with children and young people from foreign cultures who come from archaic backgrounds marked by Muslim beliefs they are uneducated and all they speak is gibberish children no longer learn anything and this is the result as to why those young people who still want to have a perspective in our country have supported the afd as much as they have as you can see the afd takes a hard line on immigration they don't want any foreigners in Germany now being against illegal immigration is one thing but the afd's rhetoric has raised concerns they've been branded and I'm quoting they've been branded as suspected extremists the German courts have given the party that status suspected extrem exists but people still voted for them the afd emerged as the biggest party in the state of thuringia it won almost 33% of the vote in neighboring Saxony the afd came a close second it pulled at over 30% but narrowly lost out to the Christian Democratic Union who won about 32% of the vote now let's look at what this really means first will the afd Govern any of these states most likely no you see no party has won an outright majority in these two states they will have to form a coalition government and all the other political parties have refused to work with the afd they have closed ranks to keep the afd out for us it is still the case as we said before the election we will not govern or form a government with the afd I am available to form a government that has a democratic majority and I have always made it clear throughout the election campaigns that I am not fighting against the CDU I am not fighting against the BSW I am not fighting against the other Democratic parties I am fighting against the normalization of fascism so the afd may not get a chance to govern not yet anyway but they aren't powerless either in turingia at least they have the power to veto certain decisions like the appointment of judges and security officials so the party will have a say in governance now to the second big question how did a farite party get so powerful in Germany after the second world war Germany rejected farite politics most Germans were ashamed of the Nazi atrocities so they distanced themselves from that brand of politics but the faride got a shot in the arm in 2015 thanks to former Chancellor Angela Merkel she allowed more than 1 million refugees to move to Germany most of these people were fleeing the civil war in Syria it was a kind gesture on her part but it's seems she underestimated the repercussions 1 million foreigners moving in led to friction especially in the East German states which are poorer than those in the west there was already a scarcity of economic opportunities here and now the locals had to compete with foreigners as well it worsened their economic situation it add to this the cultural friction the religious friction and you have the perfect storm the afd tapped into the anti-immigrant sentiment and they've been getting more popular since then so merkel's immigration policies helped Propel the rise of the German far right and her her successor Olaf sches is facing the heat Germany goes to polls next year the state elections were like a trial run and the results will give schol sleepless nights so far he has barely managed to keep the afd from taking power but who knows what will happen in the next few months [Music] minut [Music] [Applause] [Music] what we feared is happening both in West Bengal and in Kerala both States saw significant events last month in Kerala the HMA committee report came out it exposed sexual abuse in the Malayalam film industry in West Bengal the brutal rape and murder of a doctor that to inside a government Hospital both events raised the same questions why are women unsafe at their workplace what can we do to make it better both events also triggered massive outrage in Kolkata we have seen public protests today hundreds of Junior doctors gathered in the city they had won demand the Kolkata Police Commissioner must resign [Applause] there is logic to their demand Kolkata police are facing a lot of questions they acted very slowly after the murder it took them 14 hours to file an firir plus the culprit was a Civic volunteer he was using a Kolkata police bike on the day of the murder so the criticism is Justified of course the state police is not investigating the case anymore the CBI the Central Bureau of Investigation is doing that and they are building a case against the main suspect the Civic po unteer Sanjay Roy he plans to plead innocent in court his lawyer says Roy is Being Framed meanwhile the CBI is also probing a second case that of corruption at the RG car Medical College at the center of it is the ex-principal he is accused of running a mafia inside the college today he was arrested by the CBI and rumor is that he has political patronage a new audio clip is doing the rounds it features a conversation between a junior doctor and this ex principal's Aid the aid name drops the chief minister in this audio he uses political links to threaten the junior doctor now we've not been able to verify the audio the principal's Aid says it is doctored so that's where the Kolkata case is at the accused will plead not guilty and the CBI is probing corruption which brings us to Kerala top actors have been forced to break their silence including mohanlal and mamuti remember mohanlal was a chief of the artist union he res signed after the HMA committee report was published Reports say he was part of a power group a group that basically ran the industry and shielded Predators but mohanlal has denied all of it he welcomed the report's findings and he also said a cleanup is necessary don't buy it though the the very same Mohan Lal called me to a fad in 2018 so his statements clearly don't mean very much meanwhile the politics continues a female Congress leader in Kerala made some damning Revelation she said a casting couch exists in the party in the congress party a casting couch exists if you're close to Top Male leaders you get opportunities if not your career goes nowhere in response she has been removed from the Congress the party says she's working with adversaries and who is that who are these adversaries kerala's ruling Communist party fun fact about them one of their lawmakers is accused of rape actor turned emla m she's been booked for rape by the Kerala police but the Communist party has not asked him to resign it probably sums up the situation in caraline and West Bengal days of outrage days of Street protests all with drowned by the political games and this has always been India's problem we've never been short on outrage we HIIT the streets we scream from TV studios we hold candl light marches but then the the politicians roll in and we get distracted we don't know how to convert outrage into meaningful action just look at West Bengal tomorrow the government will introduce a new law death penalty for convicted rapists the hope is it will stop future crimes but guess what the crimes are already happening two assault cases have been reported in West Bengal both at hospitals on Saturday a 13-year-old girl was molested in h the same day a nurse was assaulted in beerbom do you think these criminals care about the law or the Quantum of punishment they have probably seen the protest and outrage in Kolkata yet they did not think twice before doing what they did so let's get one thing clear here outrage alone will not solve this problem nor will cosmetic political moves we need to channel that outrage into meaningful Solutions if not another Turning Point May slip away from us [Music] [Music] Espionage has two rules don't talk about what you do and don't look like a spy so who better to go undercover than animals and no one knows this like valmir I'm not talking about the Russian President Vladimir who too was a spy I'm talking about a beluga whale called valir who was who was believed to be a Russian spy the whale became a a bit of a celebrity over the years and now he has died we'll tell you all about him and answer your burning questions about wild [¬†__¬†] that roam Among Us who are they how are they trained and do they have cool gadgets here's a report the name's whale beluga whale with a license to Krill pardon the pun and an even cooler nickname valmir if this reminds you of a certain world Leader's name you aren't wrong and we'll tell you why but first what's going on with valdimir he has died that's unfortunate but why is the death of a whale making the news because this is possibly the world's most famous whale and it had a cooler job than most of us ever will valdimir is world-renowned for being a spy this is the Assumption at least no one has any proof guess valdemir did its job a little too well he was over 4 M long and weighed about 1,200 kgs kind of hard to miss he was first spotted in Norwegian Waters 5 years ago this was stranged for two reasons first belugas are rarely seen in such busy Waters this far south of the High Arctic and second the whale was spotted wearing a harness with a GoPro camera attached to it and the harness said equipment of St Petersburg this raised suspicions people wondered if the whale was on a Russian reconnaissance mission Russia has never answered the rumors or claimed ownership of the whale but if the whale was a spy he was an exceptionally friendly one the whale was comfortable around people he responded to hand signals he showed signs of domestication and he captured people's imagination almost instantly that's where he got the nickname fimir fall is the Norwegian word for whale merged with what sounds like Vladimir from the Russian president's name Vladimir Putin but now valdimir is dead and no one knows why but animal rights groups are demanding answers because valmir died at the age of 15 that's relatively young for a beluga whale whose lifespan can reach 60 years but it's certain that Russia won't be coming forward with any answers multiple sources have cited evidence of Russian programs training animals as spies but Moscow has repeatedly denied these reports this is not the first time animals have been used to spy just this year a pigeon was captured in India over accusations of spying for China the pigeon refused to Spill the Beans it didn't utter a word obviously eventually it was released after being held for 8 months it's not the only Wy animal detained over suspicions of Espionage in 2011 Sudan captured an unlikely mosad agent a vulture it apparently had a GPS tracker and weree tags from Tel Aviv in 2007 Iran arrested 14 Spies all of them squirrels being a spy is a tough enough job as is the first days are often the hardest in the 1960s the US intelligence agency the CIA spent $14 million training purring [¬†__¬†] the idea was to use cats to pick up Russian intelligence but it went bust on day one itself when a cat was run over by a car outside the Soviet Embassy in Washington occupational hazard it seems but despite this wild [¬†__¬†] will always be widely used because no one follows the first rule of spying like they do they don't look like a spy for our next story let me ask you some questions have you ever tried booking a flight a day before or booking an Uber at Peak traffic hour or even booking a hotel just hours ahead of checking if you have then kudos to you you went where others Fear To Tread and that's because of exorbitant prices last minute bookings cost a bomb reason Dynamic pricing and what's that imagine you have a product say a flight ticket the airline is a seller but it doesn't set a fixed price for the ticket the price depends on the demand if the demand is high the price goes up if the demand is low if the flight is going empty you can snag the ticket for cheap it's your basic demand and Supply principle high demand high prices low demand low prices and it is applicable for a range of things like hotel rooms ride hailing apps concert tickets movie tickets train seats anything and everything can be dynamically priced but why is it done well the United Kingdom for one is asking it last week British band Urus announced a reunion the boy band will reunite next year it is scheduled to play 17 shows and tickets for those shows went on sale one ticket was initially priced at ¬£148 one ticket for ¬£48 so fans joined the queue online to buy these tickets but once they reached the checkout they were in for a rude shock the tickets had been rebranded why because of the growing demand they were now selling for for ¬£355 a ticket so more than 100% markup and this hasn't gone down well with OS fans also with the British government where where culture secretary Lisa nandi had has slammed the inflated prices the government is launching an investigation into the pricing of tickets and this has triggered a debate on the on the practice of dynamic pricing is it good or bad is it fleecing people or just pure economics let's look at the pros first Dynamic pricing focuses on one principle the free market market forces determine the price of goods if the demand is high the charges are more if it is lower prices drop to attract more customers it helps companies pad their margins manage the inventory and align better with the market take travel for example it's a volatile industry so hotels and Airlines must adjust prices to meet the demand they can use Dynamic pricing to optimize their revenue but there's a catch in concept Dynamic pricing works both ways meaning prices can go higher or lower but in practice they seem to go only one way and that is higher or or we only notice when prices surge for example try booking a flight in offseason chances are the prices are lower than usual but we take that as granted human psyche Associates Dynamic pricing to Surge pricing only and that put of customers plus there's a nagging question who determines this demand what are the metrics used to measure it why is there no transparency in the process and that is what makes customers doubt the process they feel that the entire process is manipulative that it's a scam to fleece them take Wendy's for example it recently introduced Dynamic pricing if there were more people in a store they would pay more for a burger that's what they introduced but people were Furious they threatened to boycott the chain so Wendy's took it back then there's PVR Inox they too have Dynamic pricing for movie tickets the idea is to increase footfall but customers complain of high prices which is why we need regulation these are just two examples a lot of companies do it we need regulation because what if companies are increasing prices just for the sake of it say you order food the company says the demand is high so you pay for surge pricing but where's the proof how do you actually know that there is more traffic who regulates that so we need mechanisms in place to monitor the extent and practice of dynamic pricing so to sum it up Dynamic pricing can be a useful tool on paper it even sounds fair but the problem is the way it's implemented customers always feel that they're losing out what we need is more transparency from companies and a better understanding of how it works for customers tell us what you think what was God doing before he created the world back in the 4th Century philosopher Augustine of Hippo asked this question and then he answered it himself he said before God created the world there was no time there was no before the question is invalid when it comes to the universe you could repeat the same annoying process and ask what came before the Big Bang and most astronomers would say nothing time space matter they all began with a sudden explosion what we call the big bang but a new study is challenging this Theory it says there was a secret life before the bang our next report tells you more the big yarn the big scam or the big sham ignore us we're coming up with alternate lingo for the theory that has so far told us how the universe began we're talking about the Big B Theory that's what astronomers say birthed the universe they say it all started with a single point about 14 billion years ago the universe was trapped inside a bubble just hot tiny particles mixed with light and energy all of this thousands of times smaller than a pin head it was super cramped so the bubble was dense and hot doesn't sound very healthy so like most people in toxic relationships the universe was in desperate need for space within a fraction of a second it suddenly exploded this is called the Big Bang and the universe we know today was born and it began growing stretching in all directions tiny particles came together to form atoms then more atoms came together and we got stars planets asteroids galaxies and even black holes the universe grew at a rapid rate and it never stopped billions of years later it's still expanding that's quite the growth spurt but what if none of this is true after all the big bang is just a theory there's no proof so what if the Big Bang was not the birth of the universe what if there was life before the Big Bang this is what a new study says that our universe may have had a secret life before the Big Bang according to the study black holes already existed they contracted to form the little bubble that eventually exploded so technically atoms existed even before the Big Bang but it's not alone in coming up with the theory in modern astronomy many scientists have said something similar they say the Big Bang was not a birth but a transition phase they call this Theory the Big Crunch let's explain have you heard of a sule normally it's cool and small but if you heat it up as you should should it expands eventually the sule cools and then it collapses now imagine that the sule is a universe the Big Crunch says something similar happens to our universe it's expanding now but thanks to gravity one day everything will begin to contract it will fall inwards and collapse much like a fallen Soule now no one is going to like a collapsing Universe this will spell the Doom of everything every Galaxy every planet every ex-boyfriend's t-shirt you still cherish every comic you hold dear all of it gone and the universe will turn into a super hot super dense bubble awaiting its next big bang so these are the two camps the big bang and the Big Crunch this is kind of like Team Edward versus Team Jacob if you know what we mean but scientists have picked their favorite Theory so far no one has any proof but for a Souls like us do you know the best part it will be billions of years before the sufle will collapse if at [Music] all it's been a tough couple of days for vadodra a city in Gujarat heavy rains have left most of it flooded or had

BOMBSHELL: The Tech World Buzzing. Elon Musk has just made an announcement buying YouTube!,WLT 47 (WeloveTrump47),2024-09-03T01:53:23Z,XVDZGpBW_94,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVDZGpBW_94,"I don't think people should care what the media thinks about them they're terrible judges of character free speech is meaningless unless you allow people uh you don't like to say things you don't like at the point in which you lose uh Free Speech uh it doesn't come back in a shocking twist that has left the tech World buzzing Elon Musk has just made an announcement that no one saw coming I am officially buying YouTube find something that's meaningful to you that where you believe you're doing something good for the world well you know who's to say that something something with this information um who's the aitor of that that's right the billionaire entrepreneur known for his audacious moves with Tesla SpaceX and more recently Twitter now X is set to acquire the world's largest video sharing platform some of these conspiracy theories uh have turned out to be true that that that that was a pretty big deal there was Twitter and and and and others engag in active suppression of information that was relevant to the public what does this mean for the future of YouTube how will this acquisition reshape the digital landscape content creation and the way we consume media the world knows Elon Musk as a revolutionary entrepreneur a Visionary constantly pushing the boundaries of technology and business he has built electric cars that challenge the automotive industry launched Rockets into space and even promised to colonize Mars now it seems Elon Musk has set his sites on a new frontier YouTube Yes you heard that right rumor has it that Elon Musk is interested in buying the world's most popular video sharing platform but what could possibly be behind this unexpected move why would musk want to acquire YouTube and what changes might he have in mind today we'll explore the Intriguing reasons behind Elon musk's interest in YouTube how it aligns with his larger goals and what it could mean for creators users and the entire internet landscape chapter 1 the power of YouTube to understand why Elon Musk might be interested in buying YouTube we need to First understand the platform's immense power and influence YouTube is the second most visited website in the world after Google which also happens to own YouTube every month over 2 billion logged in users visit the site consuming over 1 billion hours of video every day it is a platform that has revolutionized content creation democratized media and given a voice to millions of creators worldwide from vloggers and Gamers to musicians and Educators YouTube has become the go-to destination for anyone with a story to tell or knowledge to share but beyond its vast audience and diverse content YouTube is also a colossal Revenue generating machine in 2022 alone YouTube's advertising Revenue was reported to be around $28 billion this makes it not only a cultural Powerhouse but also an incredibly profitable one for someone like Elon Musk who is always looking for the next big opportunity YouTube's blend of massive reach cultural significance and profitability could be too tempting to ignore chapter 2 why would Elon Musk want YouTube so why exactly would Elon Musk want to buy YouTube there are several possible reasons that align with musk's known business philosophy and goals first and foremost musk has always been a proponent of open communication and free expression recently we've seen him advocating for more transparent and less restrictive social media platforms for instance his involvement with Twitter whether through critical commentary or actual investment has always been about promoting what he perceives as freedom of speech acquiring YouTube could provide musk with the ultimate platform to further his vision of an open and less censored internet ensuring that a diverse range of voices is heard secondly musk has demonstrated a keen interest in digital Innovation Tesla and SpaceX both leverage cuttingedge technology and his Ventures like neuralink and the boring company indicate a Forward Thinking approach YouTube with its Reliance on algorithms artificial intelligence and data analytics would be a perfect addition to his portfolio of companies pushing technological boundaries it could provide him with a massive testing ground to integrate AI driven enhancements or even merge it with other technological advancements like those at neuralink third musk's focus on sustainability and green energy might also play a role in his interest in YouTube while this may seem like an unlikely connection remember that the internet and digital infrastructures are increasingly recognized for their substantial energy consumption if musk could make YouTube Greener perhaps by integrating it into his solar energy Network or leveraging spacex's satellite technology to make its data delivery more efficient it could be a GameChanger for digital sustainability additionally musk might see this acquisition as an opportunity to Foster and accelerate the development of creative content focused on science space and Technology musk is a well-known advocate for education and science he could use YouTube to amplify content that aligns with his vision nurturing a new generation of Engineers space enthusiasts and innovators finally there's the business angle buying YouTube could provide musk with a steady and substantial Revenue stream that complements his more speculative Ventures SpaceX Tesla and neuralink all involve high levels of risk and long-term planning YouTube with its established and growing user base could provide immediate and predictable cash flow balancing out his portfolio and funding his more ambitious goals like reaching Mars chapter 3 how would musk change YouTube If musk were to buy YouTube how might he change it given his track record we can expect some radical and potentially controversial shifts firstly musk would likely address issues around content moderation over the years YouTube has faced criticism for both over-regulating and under regulating content some creators and viewers have complained about demonetization Shadow Banning and unclear Community guidelines on the other hand others have expressed concerns about misinformation hate speech and harmful content musk who advocates for a free speech platform might relax some of the content restrictions allowing for a broader range of discourse this could mean fewer videos being demonetized and more transparent about what is and isn't allowed however this could also bring challenges allowing more freedom of expression might lead to the proliferation of problematic content which could impact YouTube's reputation and appeal to advertisers musk would need to balance his ideals with the Practical need to maintain YouTube's role as a safe and welcoming platform for a diverse audience second musk might push for greater integration of YouTube with other Technologies imagine watching a SpaceX launch live on YouTube and then being able to immediately interact with the spacecraft's real-time Telemetry data or having Tesla cars stream YouTube videos seamlessly or even accessing unique content through neurolink enabled devices the possibilities are endless when you think about the potential synergies between musk's various Ventures and the YouTube platform third we might see a focus on monetization and cryptocurrency musk has been a vocal supporter of digital currency like Bitcoin and Dogecoin he might introduce new ways for creators to earn money perhaps allowing them to accept payments in cryptocurrencies or rewarding them with digital tokens based on their engagement metrics this could fundamentally change how creators monetize their content providing them with more flexibility and financial autonomy fourth we could see a push towards making YouTube Greener as mentioned earlier the tech industry has a growing energy consumption problem YouTube's data centers consume vast amounts of electricity musk could use this as an opportunity to showcase his Renewable Energy Solutions imagine YouTube running on solar power generated by Tesla's solar roof or spacex's starlink satellites delivering content more efficiently this could position YouTube as a leader in sustainable Tech and differentiate it from competitors like Vimeo or Tik Tok chapter 4 what challenges would musk face in acquiring YouTube but of course acquiring YouTube wouldn't be a walk in the park even for someone as resourceful as Elon Musk there are numerous challenges he would need to overcome firstly there is the question of cost YouTube is an enormously valuable asset and even musk's vast wealth might be stretched thin alphabet Google's parent company would likely demand a hefty price possibly upwards of several hundred billion dollar even for the rich man in the world that's a significant investment musk might need to raise funds by selling shares in his other companies issuing new stock or partnering with other investors then there are the regulatory hurdles acquiring YouTube would attract intense scrutiny from Regulators worldwide governments and antitrust bodies would closely examine the deal to ensure it doesn't create a monopoly or stifle competition this could result in lengthy legal battles and significant sessions such as divesting parts of the company or agreeing to certain operational restrictions furthermore musk would need to win over YouTube's current stakeholders its employees advertisers creators and viewers many of them might be wary of a musk takeover YouTube's Workforce accustomed to the stability and culture of Google might resist the entrepreneurial and often unpredictable style of musk advertisers might fear changes to content moderation policies and creators could be concerned about monetization changes musk would need to carefully navigate these relationships to ensure a smooth transition and avoid alienating the community that makes YouTube successful lastly there is the challenge of managing a media platform unlike his previous ventures in technology transportation and energy YouTube is primarily a content-driven platform managing a media company requires a different skill set involving complex decisions about content moderation copyright issues and Community engagement while musk has shown himself to be a fast learner this would certainly be a new and complex challenge for him chapter 5 the broader implications of musk buying YouTube so what would be the broader implications of musk buying YouTube how could this affect the digital landscape media consumption and Society at large first it could spark a wave of consolidation and competition in the tech world if musk were to acquire YouTube other Tech Giants might respond by making Acquisitions of their own we could see Facebook doubling down on Instagram and WhatsApp or Amazon investing more in twitch this might lead to a new era of competition and innovation in the digital media space second it could lead to a shift in the balance of power between platforms and creators if musk implements new monetization strategies or introduces cryptocurrency payments it could Empower creators by giving them more control over how they earn money this might encourage other platforms to follow suit leading to a more Creator friendly ecosystem third musk's ownership could drive changes in content policy and moderation as mentioned earlier musk is a strong advocate for freedom of speech and he might relax some of YouTube's content restrictions this could result in a wider variety of content and more open discourse but it could also lead to challenges around misinformation hate speech and harmful content the balance between free expression and Community safety could become a major point of debate and controversy finally if musk integrates YouTube with his other Ventures we could see new forms of content and engagement that were previously unimaginable we might watch videos while interacting with Tesla's AI or experience SpaceX launches in augmented reality the convergence of different Technologies could create new types of media experiences and transform how we consume content if Elon Musk were to acquire YouTube it's almost certain that he would look for ways to revolutionize its business model currently YouTube's primary source of Revenue is advertising this model has worked well generating billions of dollars annually however it's also a model that has faced criticism from both creators and viewers alike advertisers have a significant influence over which videos are promoted or demonetized which can lead to frustration among content creators who feel that their income is subject to the whims of opaque algorithms and corporate policies Elon Musk might Envision a different kind of monetization strategy one possibility could involve reducing the platform's Reliance on traditional advertising in favor of more direct Creator to Consumer transactions for instance musk could introduce a system where viewer can directly support creators through microtransactions tips or even subscriptions much like platforms such as patreon given musk's interest in cryptocurrencies he might even facilitate payments in digital currencies like Bitcoin or Dogecoin further empowering creators to monetize their content without needing to cater to advertisers another potential shift could be towards exclusive content models musk might explore the idea of content tiers where certain videos or series are only accessible to paying subscribers imagine a model similar to Netflix or Amazon Prime but integrated within the YouTube ecosystem this could encourage highquality long form content akin to what we see on premium streaming services today but with the unique interactive and community-driven features that YouTube offers musk could also take inspiration from his work with Tesla and SpaceX where he has implemented a direct to Consumer model bypassing traditional dealerships or middlemen in the context of YouTube this could mean enabling creators to engage more directly with their audiences without platform imposed constraints imagine a YouTube where creators can sell merchandise offer paid courses or host virtual meet and greet sessions all within the YouTube platform itself such Innovations would not only generate new revenue streams but could also deepen viewer engagement and and loyalty chapter 7 Reinventing content Discovery and recommendation another area where musk could have a significant impact is YouTube's content Discovery and recommendation algorithms currently YouTube uses complex AI algorithms to suggest videos to users based on their viewing habits preferences and engagement metrics while these algorithms have been effective in keeping users on the platform they have also been criticized for creating Echo Chambers promoting Sensational or misleading content and not providing enough transparency on how they operate musk with his background in artificial intelligence through Ventures like Tesla's self-driving car technology might see an opportunity to overhaul this system he could introduce a more transparent and user Centric approach to content recommendations this might involve giving users more control over what types of content they see rather than solely relying on a a predictions for example viewers could customize their feed based on specific topics creators or even types of content they prefer such as educational videos documentaries or live streams musk might also integrate new technologies to enhance content Discovery imagine using Advanced neural networks or Quantum Computing algorithms to provide even more precise and personalized recommendations alternatively he could introduce new interfac for Content Discovery such as virtual reality VR or augmented reality AR experiences that allow users to browse videos in a virtual space or explore interactive content in a more immersive way this could significantly change how users engage with the platform making it more Dynamic and interactive moreover musk could explore using blockchain technology to create a decentralized Content recommendation system in this model instead of relying on a single centralized algorithm recommendations could be powered by a network of users who collectively decide what content gets promoted this could potentially democratize content Discovery allowing smaller creators to gain visibility based on the community's interests rather than being overshadowed by the platform's algorithmic biases chapter eight Reinventing Creator platform relationships one of the most significant changes that musk could bring to YouTube would be in the relationship between creators and the platform currently this relationship can often feel adversarial creators frequently Express frustration over demonetization unclear guidelines and abrupt policy changes musk with his track record of fostering Innovation and rewarding Talent could approach this relationship differently first he might seek to create a more transparent and predictable environment for creators this could involve clearer guidelines around content moderation demonetization and copyright issues musk could Implement a system where creators have more visibility into how their videos are performing and why certain decisions like demonetization or removal are made this transparency could help build trust between YouTube and its content creators fostering a more collaborative ecosystem musk might also introduce new forms of support for creators particularly those focusing on Niche or underrepresented content for example he could launch Grant programs or Partnerships to support creators who are producing educational scientific or socially impactful content areas that align with his broader goals of advancing knowledge and promoting Innovation this could help diversify YouTube's content landscape making it less dominated by Sensational or mainstream topics furthermore musk could experiment with new monetization models that provide creators with more financial stability instead of relying solely on ad Revenue he might introduce Revenue sharing models where creators can earn a percentage of YouTube's overall profits based on their contributions to the platform's growth alternatively he could explore creating a fund that directly compensates creators who produce highquality content similar to the way some streaming platforms pay for exclusive rights to shows or movies another significant change could be giving creators more ownership over their content currently many creators feel that platforms like YouTube control too much of their intellectual property and data musk who has a history of open- sourcing technology and advocating for greater user control might push for policies that give creators more rights over their videos data and brand this could include allowing creators to easily move their content to other platforms export their subscriber lists or even sell their videos as nfts non-fungible tokens giving them more flexibility and potential Revenue opportunities chapter n enhancing user experience and engagement Elon Musk is known for his focus on user experience whether it's making electric vehicles fun and intuitive to drive or designing rockets that look straight out of a science fiction movie if he were to buy YouTube we could expect a similar emphasis on enhancing user experience and engage engagement one of the areas musk could focus on is reducing the friction that users often experience when navigating YouTube currently the platform can feel overwhelming due to the sheer volume of content and the complex way it is organized musk might simplify the user interface making it more intuitive and easier to find the content users want he could also introduce new features like voice commands AI assisted search or even arvr integration to make navigating YouTube more engaging and userfriendly musk might also look into improving the way users interact with content for example he could introduce more interactive elements such as live polls augmented reality experiences or 360¬∞ videos that allow viewers to explore scenes in real time this could create a more Dynamic and immersive viewing experience encouraging users to spend more time on the platform another potential area for Innovation is social integration YouTube unlike other social media platforms doesn't have a strong emphasis on community building musk could change that by introducing features that encourage more social interaction such as group video watching sessions enhanced commenting systems or real-time collaboration tools for creators he could also integrate YouTube more closely with other social media platforms allowing for seamless sharing and cross-platform engagement moreover musk could lever Lage his expertise in AI to create smarter content moderation systems currently YouTube relies heavily on automated systems to detect and remove inappropriate content but these systems are far from perfect musk could deploy more advanced AI models capable of understanding context better and distinguishing between harmful content and satire education or commentary this could help reduce false positives and negatives creating a safer and more fair environment for both creators and viewers chapter 10 YouTube's potential role in musk's broader Vision to understand why Elon Musk might want to buy YouTube It's essential to consider how it could fit into his broader vision for Humanity musk has often spoken about his desire to make human life multiplanetary accelerate the transition to renewable energy and enhance human cognition and health through Advanced Technologies like brain machine inter faces One Way YouTube could fit into this vision is as a platform for education and knowledge dissemination musk is a strong advocate for Education as evidenced by his founding of AD asra a school that focuses on science math and critical thinking he might view YouTube as a powerful tool for democratizing Education making highquality free content accessible to people around the world he could encourage more scientific content host online lectures by Leading experts or even launch new educational initiatives through the platform reaching Millions more people than traditional educational methods mus could also use YouTube to advance his other goals such as promoting electric vehicles or space exploration imagine dedicated channels that provide real-time updates from SpaceX missions exclusive behind the scenes looks at Tesla's latest developments or live Q&A sessions with engineers and scientists working on groundbreaking Technologies this would not only generate excitement around his companies but also Foster a deeper public understanding of the technologies that are shaping our future additionally musk could leverage YouTube to promote environmental awareness and sustainability given YouTube's vast reach it could become a platform for sharing content on climate change renewable energy and sustainable living practices musk could partner with creators who focus on these topics providing them with resources and incentives to produce highquality engaging content that raises awareness and inspires action on critical Global issues chapter 11 the global impact of a musk owned YouTube If musk were to acquire YouTube the impact would not be confined to just the United States YouTube is a global platform with users all over the world and any changes musk implements would have far-reaching consequences in regions where internet access is still growing musk's ownership of YouTube could coincide with efforts to expand internet access through his other Venture starlink by providing affordable high-speed internet to underserved areas musk could potentially bring millions of new users onto the platform this would not only expand YouTube's reach but also open up new opportunities for Content creation and consumption in diverse regions musk might also push for greater localization of content currently YouTube's content is heavily skewed towards English-speaking audiences with limited support for content in other languages or from other cultural perspectives mus could invest in creating tools and resources to support multilingual content creation translation and distribution making YouTube a more inclusive platform that better represents the world's diversity furthermore musk's Global Ambitions could lead to changes in how YouTube operates in countries with strict content regulations or censorship laws as an advocate for free speech and transparency musk might challenge existing norms advocating for greater freedom of expression on the platform this could put him at odds with governments around the world potentially leading to Legal battles or even the platform being banned in certain countries however musk's determination to uphold his principles could also lead to positive changes encouraging more open and Democratic access to information in regions where it is currently restricted chapter 12 final thoughts and speculation while the idea of Elon Musk buying YouTube is still speculative it's clear that such a move would have profound implications musk is not just a businessman he is a Visionary who thinks on a grand scale and his potential acquisition of YouTube would likely reflect that whether it's through fostering Innovation promoting transparency or challenging the status quo musk's influence on YouTube could reshape the platform and perhaps the internet itself in ways we can only begin to imagine of course with great power comes great responsibility and musk would have to navigate a complex landscape of stakeholders regulators and users his every move would be scrutinized and his decisions could have far-reaching consequences for the future of online content free expression and digital media would YouTube under musk's leadership become a Utopia of open information and Innovation or would it face new challenges and controversies only time will tell what is certain however is that if Elon Musk does decide to buy YouTube it will be one of the most significant teex stories of our time one that could change the way we connect communicate and create in the digital age Elon musk's potential interest in buying YouTube is a story that captures the imagination it brings together the world's most influential entrepreneur and the most powerful video sharing platform while the idea is still speculative the reasons behind it are compelling and the implications could be profound whether it's fostering free expression integrating cuttingedge technology promoting sustainability or reshaping the Creator economy musk's ownership of YouTube could redefine the future of digital media yet as with any major acquisition there would be significant challenges and risks involved from regulatory scrutiny to stakeholder resistance the path to acquiring YouTube would be far from easy but if there's one thing we know about Elon Musk it's that he loves a challenge and if he does decide to pursue this audacious goal the world will be watching closely to see how he plans to change everything once again in the end whether musk buys YouTube or not his interest in the platform underscores the growing importance of digital media in our lives it reminds us that the internet is constantly evolving shaped by The Visionaries and innovators who dare to dream big and in this rapidly changing world one thing is certain whatever musk does next it will be something that none of us could have predicted I think danger of AI is much greater than the the the danger of nuclear warheads by a lot mark my word words AI is far more dangerous than nukes far so why do we have no regulatory oversight it's just outside of human control it's going to be very tempting to use AI as a weapon it's going to be very tempting in fact it will be used as a weapon the danger is humans using it against each other I think most likely that'll be the danger a NE device is kind of like a a Fitbit or an Apple Watch we take out a sort of a small section of skull about the size of a quarter um replace that with tiny tiny wires very very tiny wires we we have aspirationally do do the first uh human implant this year one of the biggest risks it could be the biggest risk I think we need to watch out about uh population collapse this is uh somewhat counterintuitive to most people they think that well there's so many humans maybe too many humans uh but that's just cuz they live in City Elon Musk is known for his outspoken views on a variety of topics but none perhaps are as urgent and provocative as his warnings about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence AI in a series of discussions and interviews musk has continually emphasized the risks associated with rapid AI advancements and the need for stringent oversight and regulation one of musk's primary concerns is the rapid Pace at which AI is advancing he has noted that AI has been evolving quickly and that tools like chat GPT have made these advancements accessible and visible to the general public however this accessibility also brings to light the potential risks as these Technologies become more integrated into everyday life on on a more sort of near term time frame I think artificial intellig is something we need to be quite concerned about and really be uh attentive to the safety of of AI um you mentioned the chat GPT earlier um you know I I I played a significant role in the creation of open AI um essentially at the time I was concerned that Google uh was not uh paying enough attention to I safety and and so I I I with a number of other people created open AI although initially it was created as an open source nonprofit and now it is closed source and for profit but I I don't have any stake in open AI anymore nor nor am I on the board nor do I control it in any way but the the chat GPT I think has Illustrated to uh people just how advanced AI has become because the a has been Advanced for a while it just didn't have a user interface that was um accessible to most people um so what really chat GPT has done is just put an an accessible user interface on AI technology that is um has been present for a few years and there are much more advanced versions for that that are coming out so I think we you know I think we we need to really be I think we need to regulate AIC frankly musk compares the current state of AI to the early days of the automobile industry where safety measures like seat belts and airbags were initially resisted by manufacturers but eventually mandated by Regulators he believes that similar regulatory oversight is essential for AI to prevent catastrophic outcomes without such measures the reaction to any negative consequences could be too slow leading to potentially irreversible damage you know the cars were unregulated at the beginning aircraft were unregulated um but they had lots of um you know airplane crashes and in some cases manufacturers that were cutting Corners um and and a lot of people were dying so they the public was not happy about that and so they established a regulatory authority to to improve safety and now commercial airliners are um extremely safe in fact they're safer than than if you were to drive somewhere uh it's the safety per mile of a commercial airliner is better than a car and and cars are also extremely safe compared to where they used to be um so um but if you say if you look at say the introduction of seat belts uh the Auto industry fought the introduction of seat belts um as a safety measure for I think 10 or 15 years um before finally The Regulators made them put seat belts in cars and that greatly improved the safety of cars um and then airbags were another big Improvement in safety so um my concern is that with AI if if there's something bad that something goes wrong the reaction might be too slow from a regulatory standpoint musk has been vocal about the need for a regulatory body to overc AI safety he argues that just as there are agencies dedicated to ensuring the safety of pharmaceuticals food and transportation there should be a dedicated Agency for AI the potential risks posed by AI especially as it approaches or surpasses human intelligence necessitate proactive measures to ensure it develops in a way that is beneficial to humanity well I've said for a long time I think AI safety is a really big deal um and we should have some regulatory agency that is overseeing uh AI safety um but there is not yet currently any such thing and and just generally any kind of regulatory agency done by the government will usually Tak years to put in place you know after uh the population collapse issue I think AI safety is probably the second biggest threat to the future of civilization like I said I'm not quite sure what to do with it I mean Tesla is arguably the the world's biggest robot maker cuz like we have basically semi semi-autonomous cars that will ultimately be fully autonomous um and we are building a humanoid robot that will be basically like um like like the car but with legs and I I kind of uh held off on doing that for a while because you know I I certainly don't want to hasten the AI apocalypse but clearly with looking Boston Dynamics and like there humanoid robots are going to happen so um they're really going to happen with it without Tesla so it's like Tesla I've got a little bit more I mean a lot more ability to ensure uh robotics safety and AI um and I'll try my best to to do that the creation of of open AI in which musk played a significant role was initially driven by his concerns about AI safety he and others believed that AI development needed to be transparent and focused on positive outcomes however musk has since distanced himself from open AI citing its transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit model and his lack of control over its direction essentially at the time I was concerned that Google uh was not uh paying enough attention to AI safety and and so I I with a number of other people created open AI although initially it was created as an open source nonprofit and now it is closed source and for-profit I I don't have any stake in open AI anymore nor nor am I on the board nor do I control it in any way but the the chat GPT I think has Illustrated to uh people just how advanced AI has become um because the AI has been Advanced for a while it just didn't have a user interface that was um accessible to most people so what really chat GPT has done is just put an an accessible user interface on AI technology that is um been present for a few years and there are much more advanced versions for that that are coming out so I think we you know I think we we need to really be I think we need to regulate AIC frankly musk's warnings about AI are not limited to its potential to surpass human intelligence he also highlights the risk of AI being used as a weapon either by Rogue States or individuals the temptation to use AI for military or strategic advantage is significant and musk believes that this could lead to Dangerously unpredictable outcomes so you used to have more hope and you gave [Music] a [Music] he [Music] [Music] aahah [Music] it's many years this is the normal course of things furthermore mask discusses the concept of artificial general intelligence AGI or digital super intelligence which he describes as AI that can outperform humans in every way the development of AGI could lead to a future where AI operates independently of human control pursuing goals that may not align with human values or interests this decoupling from Collective human will is a scenario that musk finds particularly alarming artificial general intelligence or digital super intelligence uh decouples from a collective human will and uh goes in a direction that for some reason we don't like whatever whatever Direction it might go you know that's what sort of the idea behind neural is to try to more tightly couple uh of human world to uh the to to digital uh super intelligence and also along the way solve a lot of um brain injuries and spinal injuries and that kind of thing even if it doesn't succeed in the greater goal it will I think it will succeed in in the uh goal of alleviating uh Brain and Spine damage so the spirit there is that if we're going to make these AIS that are so vastly intelligent we ought to be wired directly to them so that we ourselves can have those superpowers more more directly that doesn't seem to avoid the risk that those superpowers might um turn ugly in an unintended way no I think it's a risk I agree I I I don't I'm not saying that I have some U certain uh answer to that risk I'm I'm I'm just saying like maybe one of the things that would be good for ensuring that the future is one that we want is to more tightly couple human world Collective human world to digital intelligence one of musk's proposed solutions to mitigate the risks of AI is neuralink a company he founded to develop brain machine interfaces neuralink aims to create a closer integration between human and digital intelligence potentially allowing humans to keep Pace with AI advancements musk envisions a future where neuralink can help address the civilizational risks posed by AI by ensuring that human intelligence evolves alongside digital intelligence the idea behind neural link is to try to more tightly couple uh Collective human world to uh the to to digital uh superintelligence and also along the way solve uh brain injuries and spinal injuries that kind of thing so even if it doesn't succeed I mean the fundamental principles of uh of reading neurons uh so doing rewrite on neurons with tiny electrodes um have been demonstrated for decades um so it's not like uh this is uh the concept is new what the problem is that there's no product uh that works well that you can go and uh and buy so it's it's all sort of in research Labs um and it's it's not it's uh like there's always like some cord sticking out of your your head and it's it's quite gruesome and it's it's really um there there's no good product uh that that that actually does a good job and is high bandwidth and safe and something you'd actually that you could buy and would want to buy so the way to think of the neuralink device is kind of like u a Fitbit or an Apple watch um that's uh where we we take out a sort of a small section of skull about the size of a quarter um replace that with what in many ways really is very much like um f put Apple watch or or some kind of Smartwatch thing and and but but with with tiny tiny wires very very tiny wires wires so tiny it's hard to even see them and it's very important to have very tiny wires that you when they're implanted they don't they don't damage the brain neural linkx technology is also intended to have more immediate applications such as helping individuals with injuries or neurological conditions however its long-term goal is to create a symbiotic relationship between humans and AI which musk believes is essential for ensuring that AI develops in a way that is aligned with human values um other people fuse this word and and and that this is my prediction will be an age of abundance for everyone I guess there's uh the dangers would be the artificial general intelligence or digital super intelligence uh decouples from a a collective human will and uh goes in a direction that for some reason we don't like whatever whatever Direction it might go you know that's what sort of the idea behind neural link is to try to more tightly uh Collective human world to the to to digital uh super intelligence and also along the way solve a lot of brain injuries and spinal injuries and that kind of thing so even if it doesn't succeed in the greater goal it will I think it will succeed in in the uh goal of alleviating uh Brain and Spine damage it really will be many years before we have anything uh approximating A high bandwidth uh neural interface uh that allows for uh AI human symbiosis and for for many years we will just be solving uh brain injuries and spinal injuries for probably a decade um and this is not something that will suddenly one day it'll we'll have this incredible uh sort of uh whole brain interface um like I said at least a decade of of really just solving um brain injuries and and spinal injuries um and and really I think you can solve a very wide range of of brain injuries including severe depression uh morbid obesity uh sleep uh potentially schizophrenia like a lot of things that cause great stress to people uh restoring uh memory in all the people musk is also concerned about the intern aspect of AI development he acknowledges that some countries such as China May Advance AI technology without the same regulatory oversight that he advocates for this could create a competitive disadvantage for countries that Implement strict regulations potentially leading to an AI arms race however musk also notes that government officials in China are aware of the risks associated with AI and are likely to implement their own oversight measures the challenge is to ensure that Global standards for AI safety are established and adhered to preventing any one country from Gaining a disproportionate advantage through unchecked AI development but but the rebuttal I get is like well you know China is going to have unfettered uh AI development and so if we have regulations and that slows us down then China will have it and I'm like look I from my conversations with the government officials in China they they they they're quite concerned about AI I think we should have uh a government oversight just like we do we have a government oversight and regulation of uh cars and aircraft and uh food and pharmaceuticals these are all uh you know there's a there are Regulators that oversee uh these developments to ensure Public Safety um and I think uh AO digital superintelligence would also be potentially of public safety risk and so it should be it's I think it's very important to for Regulators to keep an eye on that one of the biggest risks it could be the biggest risk I think we need to watch out about uh population collapse this is uh somewhat counterintuitive to most people uh they think that well there's so many humans maybe too many humans uh but that's just cuz they live in a city uh if you're an aircraft and you look down you say if you dropped a a cannonball how often would you hit a person basically never in fact there stuff falling in from space all the time natural meteorites old rocket stages all the time um but nobody worries about it cuz the the actual in fact there's a good a cool website called wait but why and this guy Tim and like he actually just did the math and and uh all humans on Earth could fit in the city of New York on one floor don't even need the upper floors so that's actually the cross-section of of humans as seen from Earth is extremely tiny basically vanishingly small almost nothing um so we need to watch out about population collapse this low birth rate I think is um big risk and it's also not exactly top secret you can go look at the Wikipedia and this this is actually this this is this is definitely the civilization ends with a with a whimper not a bang uh because it would be a sad ending um where the the average age becomes very high and really the youth are effectively uh de facto enslaved to take care of the old people in addition to his concerns about AI musk also highlights the issue of population collapse due to low birth rates he argues that this is a significant risk to the future of civilization as an aging population could place unsustainable burdens on younger Generations musk believes that addressing population collapse is essential for ensuring a stable and prosperous future a super low birth rate really yeah over like nuclear war don't we have an overpopulation problem no we have an underpopulation problem really yeah why why this is the most commonly misunderstood situation yeah they definitely push that we have a overation no no we I don't know it's just like I think it's like this is a hold over from like I don't know the 70s or something you know so there was a huge um baby boom like where people did have a ton of kids after World War II but then the US has actually been had the growth rate in the US has been below replacement rate Japan actually uh lost like 600 thou went down by 600,000 people last year the Japanese are not in the bedroom at all then it would it would seem not what about what about the us we got an increase right yeah what I'm saying is the US has been below replacement rates for 50 years only incre since the 70s yeah since the early 70s since like 71 72 um so why are we spewed with all this BS that yo we're overpopulating but the population's growing right no it's not so I mean should say like lifespan is increasing MH um people are living longer that's the only reason why the population of Earth isn't plummeting but it will plumm it he also emphasizes the importance of transitioning to sustainable energy resources musk describes the current practice of extracting and burning fossil fuels as a crazy experiment that poses significant risks to the environment he advocates for accelerating the transition to sustainable energy to mitigate these risks the atmosphere and the oceans we're taking vast amounts of carbon from deep underground and putting this putting this in the in the in the atmosphere this is crazy we should not do this it's very dangerous so we should we should we should accelerate the transition to sustainable energy I mean this the bizarre thing is that obviously we're going to run out of oil in the long term you know we're going to there's only so much oil we can we can mine and burn it's tot logical we must have Su a sustainable energy transport and energy infrastructure in the long term so we know that's the end point we know that so why run this crazy experiment where we take trillions of tons of carbon from underground and put it in the atmosphere and oceans this is an insane experiment it's the dumbest experiment in in human history why are we doing this it's crazy musk often references the concept of the singularity a point at which AI advancements become so rapid and profound that predicting future developments becomes impossible while the singularity is not inherently good or bad it represents a significant ific unknown that requires careful consideration and preparation the Advent of artificial general intelligence is called The Singularity for a reason because just like a black hole which is a singular Singularity it's difficult to predict what will happen so it's not as though the Advent of AGI is necessarily bad but it's bad as one of the possible outcomes so I think we really should take this seriously the population collapse artificial intelligence obviously sustainable energy is important uh the faster we transition to sustainable energy the less of a gamble we're taking with climate I think there's going to be a lot of breakthroughs on the medical front uh particularly around synthetic uh mRNA uh Al you can basically do anything with the synthetic uh RNA DNA um it's it's like a computer program neur is really just going to um help cure uh brain injuries and brain and spine injuries so it's like if if somebody's a in fact our first implanted devices in humans will be for quadriplegics tetrolic allowing them to control a computer or a phone just using the M um so like you can imagine like if Steven Hawking could just talk uh and normal speed or even faster than normal speed in view the concentration of AI power in the hands of a few individuals or entities poses a significant risk he cites a quote from Lord Acton Freedom consists of the distribution of power and despotism in its concentration musk believes that ensuring AI power is distributed and not concentrated is essential for preventing a dystopian future I mean I I am concerned about um certain directions that AI could take that would be not good for the future that I mean I think it would be fair to say that like not all AI Futures are benign not not all okay um and and so if you have something if if there if we create some digital super intelligence that exceeds Us in every way by a lot wouldn't that that be benign there's a quote that I love from uh bo Act and he was the guy that came up with power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely um which is that uh Freedom consists of the distribution of power and despotism in its concentration and so I think it's important if we have this incredible power of AI that it not be concentrated in the hands of a few and potentially lead to a world that we don't want the goal of open of open AI is really just to take the set of actions that are most likely to improve the positive fure Futures like if you can think of like the future as a set of of probability streams that that that Branch out and then converge collapse down to a particular event and then Branch out again and uh there's a certain set of probability associated with the future being positive and different type flaves of that and uh an open the eye we want to try to do whatever we can to guide to to increase the probability of the good Futures happening I think that's that's really what we're trying to do do you worry that by making this open some Bad actors may use some of what has been developed to do bad stuff uh with power I mean that that is certainly the the the I mean a good rutal to that um however I think if AI power is widely distributed um then and there's not one entity that has some super AI that is a million times smarter than anything else you know if instead AI power is broadly distributed and to the degree that we can link uh AI power to each individual's will um so like you know you would have your AI agent you knew it like everyone would have their sort of AI agent and then if somebody did try to do something really terrible well then the collective will of others could overcome that bad actor Elon musk's warnings about AI are a call to action for society to take the potential risks seriously his advocacy for regulatory oversight responsible development and proactive measures to ensure AI benefits Humanity reflects his deep concern for the future as AI continues to advance musk's insights provide a valuable perspective on the importance of balancing Innovation with safety and ethical consider Generations his efforts to expose the whole thing underscore the urgency of addressing these challenges before it's too late"

spend it on and how not to make a mistake Bitcoin and Oil Man in cryptocurrency you have probably heard these words even if you do not distinguish ether from Litecoin and the Novelties and scripts of the world surround us more and more densely this graffiti on the wall May well become the basis for a new expensive n onar f type this guy on an expensive foreign car maybe bought Bitcoin back in 2009 and that's why he got so rich and there are no video cards for a computer in stores well of course and for miners many of you probably understood what I'm talking about now for others new words were possible similar nicknames spells from Harry Potter but it will be useful for both of them to understand the topic of cryptocurrencies more deeply especially now when through crypto you can withdraw money abroad or order goods from abroad I gathered experts to understand what cryptocurrencies are where they came from how blockchain works and how mining happens and also today I'll tell you how to buy cryptocurrency most safely where and how to store and how to use the institute on you can do anything even one pixel you can put up as an Institute how much Russia could earn this is very useful for the development of our Civilization now the guides covered their hands that participate in the operation this video which I prepared for quite a long time I am ready for you so that if you still do not know figure out what it is cryptocurrency because no matter what anyone says but cryptocurrencies are not even some kind of our future they are our present music a large database of exchangers can be found on without cinch this internet service has been operating on the market for 15 years helping to find exchange offices with the most favorable rate each of the exchangers that are in the database is carefully checked by the service employees on without whose you can choose an exchanger not only by rating and reviews but also by the exchange rate the information on the site is updated every 58 seconds that is you see the current rate almost in real time in order to make a deal you need to select pairs of currencies that you want to sell or buy the service will give a list of exchangers sorted by rate siiz commissions itself without part does not charge for its services and if not one exchange rate suits you you can Subs subscribe to a notification when the cost of the transaction you're interested in changes a message will come from without whose cryptocurrency today has become one of the few ways to transfer money abroad or pay for Foreign Service this is especially relevant for those who have left from the country but continues to work for Russian companies remotely receive salary on Russian cards for example turkey and Armenia cryptocurrency is accepted by some homeowners to ship bars and cafes but I want to remind you that cryptocurrency is still a risky investment tool so before investing digital coins real money it is worth properly understanding this issue but if you are interested in violent operations then you can use the monitoring of exchangers without a check on the link in the description of this video well first let's discuss what what is blockchain such as the blockchain technology thanks to which cryptocurrency appeared blockchain is literally translated from English language as a chain of blocks and this is a fairly accurate description this chain of information blocks Each of which stores the memory of a family not the previous block the chain can be endlessly added new Beast change or delete previous you cannot want to explain what it was very even your grandmother let him see how she knits socks if a sock is someone's entire block each new Stitch is a new block of the chain and it is no longer possible to change old stitches but only if you untangle the entire sock the main feature of the blockchain is its openness and distributed openness means that any user can check each block of the chain and all information that is stored there well for example in a bank you will never know about the transfer of money from one user to another without special access in the blockchain everything is fundamentally different in the blockchain this information will be open if the blockchain was the basis of the financial system then requesting more money from the budget and keeping half in your pocket it would no longer work because all the money transfers they would be visible they would be absolutely transparent as for the distribution of the blockchain pool there is no owner and no management blocks are distributed between all Network users for one block to appear confirmation from several sources is required that is for you to transfer money within the blockchain for example to your friend this operation must be confirmed as available several users completely unfamiliar to to you while none of them will be the main confirming thus the block is very small and it is practically impossible for such a situation to occur when data becomes unavailable due to a service or video crash so to put it simply in this system it is impossible to arrest or turn off any specific computers so that all the money disappears there and in this regard yes of course it is much more reliable than for example the current banking system stable coins are cryptocurrency tied to real assets the most famous of them became the T for which Bush the US dollar rate is tied and even in 19 meare the creators of the currency assured that 74% of all assets teaser are provided with real dollars in bank accounts which allows maintaining the exchange rate now this is the most popular style was coin in the world and the third largest crypto currency after Bitcoin and ether

IT HAPPENED! Elon Musk JUST Bought Instagram,Elon Musk Fan Zone,2024-09-02T23:59:06Z,uelrpt9H_yA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uelrpt9H_yA,Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has just caught the social media Space by storm after buying Twitter the tech icon has initiated a plan of buying Instagram why is Elon buying the photo sharing platform and at what price will the IG purchase be more complicated than the Twitter one join me today in this video as we explore why when and how Elon is buying Instagram Elon Musk is not yet done with the social media industry after taking Twitter private on the 25th of April he has now turned his focus on the photo sharing site Instagram there is no doubt that Elon is a man on a mission and he wants to totally transform the social media space apparently the only way for him to sanitize the social media industry is by taking the various social media networks private the majority of the social media users have welcomed elon's plan of reforming the industry given that it has been very toxic in the past few years the level of concern even goes was hire for a site like Instagram where 40% of the users are below 23 years of age a lot of Youth like the social media site as it gives them a platform where they can share with others communicate with peers and even follow their friends it is unfortunate that such young minds are exploited and bullied on the platform teen girls are the most affected on Instagram it is said that some of them have even lost their lives but how does all of this come to be as earlier mentioned Instagram is is a site that is primarily used for sharing photos and short videos consequently the teens are drawn into a spiral of negative social comparison of their body size and shapes many at times the girls have low self-esteem when their pictures do not attract a good number of likes compared to their peers in the end this leads to stress and depression the Tesla CEO wants to buy Instagram so that he can remove the features that promote comparison in the past the tech icon has noted that most people on IG live a false life the pictures that they post on the site is not a true representation of what happens in their real life in his own words the tech icon says people are posting pictures of when they were really happy they're modifying those pictures to be better looking even if they're not modifying those pictures they're selecting the pictures for the best lighting the best angle a musk emphasize that most people post their good piics just for other people to see that they are doing well in Instagram some of the people that appear to be the happiest may turn out to be the saddest people in reality the Tesla founder and CEO has made it clear that no one will be doing well all the time regardless of their social or financial status another problem that musk seeks to solve in Instagram is the illegal and inappropriate content that is uploaded by users it is regrettable that some users upload pornographic content on the platform which is inappropriate for the big number of teens on the social media site other users on the photo sharing site also post some picks that promote violence the world's richest man also seeks to change the algorithm that is on the site as it causes people to be addicted the addiction comes into play as the algorithm will always recommend post that the user is interested in the time that is wasted on IG can be used to do other things that are more productive similarly most Instagram users are less productive at work as they use most of their time checking on any updates on the social media a site the addiction on the site is also promoted by the various hashtags that are synonymous with the site a very good example is selfie Sunday where the users will share their selfies the Tesla billionaire Elon Musk is also set to reduce the amount of advertising that happens on the social media platform generally ads ruin a person's experience online as they distract a person from what they are focusing on musk is said to introduce a premium service of IG which is similar to Twitter blue the premium IG will probably be costing the same as Twitter blue where users subscribe for $3 per month but the tech icon is soon reducing the amount to $2 per month it is quite interesting to see whether musk will decide to merge Twitter and Instagram or leave them to be Standalone companies just like the case of Twitter musk is expected to pay more money than the current market cap of the platform in the case of Twitter he paid $44 billion while the market cap was $39 billion in the case of Instagram musk is expected to pay around $110 billion given that the company has a market cap of 102 billion it is quite common for the established social media platforms to buy the smaller social media sites in 2014 Facebook now meta purchased WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2006 Google bought YouTube for $1.6 billion today the video streamer is worth much more bringing in more than 28.8 billion dollar in Revenue each year while Elon Musk introduced payment via Dogecoin on Twitter the crypto Enthusiast is said to introduce non-fungible tokens on IG there is a possibility that you have heard the words cryptocurrency and nfts and you could be wondering what is the difference between the two words Wonder no more here's the simple and main difference between the two cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin are fungible which simply means you can exchange one Dogecoin for another as they have the same value but on the other end non-fungible tokens as the name suggests they are not fungible which simply means you cannot exchange one nft with another as each nft has its own unique value an nft is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain here is how it all happens assuming you have a physical asset such as a painting that you greatly treasure nfts gives you a chance of not only owning the painting physically but also in digital sense as such what you have to do is to take a quality pick of the item once you have the pick you can run it in a blockchain so that it gets a unique identity after that you can give your new digital asset a price tag and start selling it online the beauty of it all is that you get to give it whatever price that you want other people who want to own the digital image will have to reach out to you so that you can sell it to them even with your physical painting you won't be able to come up with another Digital Image as the blockchain technology does not allow replication so with the new feature instead of people just posting photos on IG they will now be doing business with the pics there is every possibility that the business-like environment in the platform May reduce the level of toxicity on the site as people will tend to be more professional Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack dorsy is a man who has gained from the world of nfts the Tweet which says just setting up my Twitter was first posted in March 2006 and was auctioned off last year by Mr dorsy for charity Mr aavi bought the tweet in the form of an nft in March 2021 Jack sold the nft for $2.9 million and donated the amount to a charity organization that was fighting covid-19 in Africa but what is mind-blowing is that just a year later Mr aavi is selling the tweet for $48 million success in the social media industry is majorly measured by the number of users that a certain platform has high numers simply mean that the site can easily reach out to many people many advertisers go for a micro blogging site that has more people so that they can reach a high audience so how many users does IG have with roughly 1 billion monthly active users Instagram belongs to the most popular social media networks worldwide the social photo sharing app is especially popular in India and in the United States which has 2011 million and 157 million Instagram users each Facebook is on the top of the social media platforms that have most people as it has more than 3.5 billion users it is followed by WhatsApp which has 2 billion active users the number of WhatsApp users is expected to rise even higher as it is the most popular messaging app in the world Tik Tok which is the most recent has 1 billion people while Elon musk's Twitter has 400 million people having bought Twitter and now Instagram Elon Musk is said to be the king of the social media industry it does seem like we're at a point where all of a sudden it happened fast we're we're beyond words and rhetoric Beyond politics Beyond process right now you have illegal aliens coming into our country many from prisons and many from uh mental institutions and they want to give them votes Elon Musk unequivocally agrees with every action and decision made by a certain individual throughout their entire life endorsing them 100% wholeheartedly I think there's you know people tend to take like say an endorsement as um well I I agree with everything that person has ever done their entire life 100% wholeheartedly and that's that's not going to be true of anyone um but we have to pick you we got two choices really for for who's President and it's not not just who's president but the entire admin administrative structure uh changes over um and I thought Trump displayed uh courage Under Fire objectively um you know he's uh just got got blood streaming down his face and he's like pist pumping saying fight you know like that's uh impressive like you can't Fain bravery in a situation like that um like most people would have be ducking there would not be cuz it could be a second shooter you don't know um the the president United States got to represent the country and uh they're representing you they're representing everyone in America well think you want someone who is strong and courageous uh to represent the country um that's not to say that he is without flaws we all have flaws um but on balance um and certainly at the time it was um a choice of you know Biden po poor guy you know has trouble climbing a flight of stairs and the other one's P pumping after getting this is no no comparison I mean who do you want dealing with uh some of the toughest people in you know other world leaders who are pretty tough themselves and um I mean I'll tell you like what are the things that I think are important um you know I think we want a secure border we don't have a secure border um but we want safe and Clean Cities I think we want to reduce the amount of spending that were at least slow down the the spending musk warns that the current rate of expenditure is on a trajectory to bankrupt the nation a fiscal disaster in the making and uh because we're we're currently spending at a rate that is bankrupting the country the interest payments on US debt this year exceeded the entire defense department spending if this continues all of the Federal Government taxes will simply be paying the interest and then and you you keep go going down that road and you end up you know in the tragic situation that Argentina had back in the day Argentina used to be one of the most prosperous places in the world and hopefully with Malay taking over he can restore that but um it's it was an incredible fful Grace for Argentina to go from being one of the most prosperous places in the world to um being very far from that so I think we should not take American prosperity for granted um so we really want to I think we we've got to reduce the size of government we've got to reduce the spending and we've got to live within our means you have to really have take an active role in reducing the number of laws and regulations otherwise as more and more laws and regulations are passed eventually everything becomes IL legal right right um and you start getting into these oan situations where then everyone's poor and miserable well well where where action a is illegal and action B is illegal and there isn't anything you can do that is legal take an example of of um to give example of some some laware that was leveled against SpaceX for example we were told for many years that we could not hire anyone who was not a permanent yeah right so SpaceX develops Advanced rocket technology which is considered um uh an advanced weapons technology because it's it's a core part of like inter intercontinental ballistic missiles y so there are only a handful of things in the sort of highest level of weapon technology and and Rocket technology is one of those because we could deliver a payload and basically anywhere on earth right from anywhere on Earth so um so we he reveals that the government explicitly threatened him with imprisonment if he hired anyone who wasn't a permanent resident of the United States I was told in no uncertain terms by the government that if we hired anyone who is not a uh permanent resident of the United States uh have either green card or a citizen that I would go to prison oh yeah um because the presumption if somebody's not a permanent resident is that they will leave the United States and take the rocket technology from SpaceX to potentially to countries that will cause harm to the United States right right pretty you know solid reasoning I think hey let's pay attention to what people actually want and the lack of interest in that question in Washington is something that ultimately drove me out of the city after 35 years lawmakers stepping over the prostrate bodies of their fellow citizens oding on to go cast votes to send money to some foreign country yeah actually we've lost more Americans from in the past four years than we lost in World War II yeah our bloodiest more than we lost in World War II does anybody care it is pathetic it is pathetic and do you hear a single word from Washington about doing anything about we know where are coming from we know the supply routes the US military spent billions the hoian trail you don't see our commanderin-chief suggesting that we use our military to protect our country or the lives of its citizens no that's for and it's too much actually it's too insulting it's too insulting it's a middle finger in the face of every American it's a very clear statement which is unmistakable and that is we don't care about you and Donald Trump whatever you say about him and I think he's a wonderful person I know him well by the way the the funniest person I've ever met in my life actually you can't be funny without perspective or without empathy which is true but everything else about Trump aside he actually cares because he's interested in the people who lives here live here because that's his job a father's job his duty is to his family an officer's duty is to his men a President's duty is to his citizens Tucker Carlson posits that had the Ambush on Trump succeeded Biden would have undoubtedly remained a presidential candidate altering the political landscape I think it's pretty clear that if the attempt on Trump had succeeded that Biden would have stayed in people can draw their own conclusions from that but I I believe that it seems obvious to me that all of these things are connected it does seem like we're at a point where all of a sudden happened fast were were beyond words and rhetoric Beyond politics Beyond process even and we're dealing with people who are absolutely W to other people for power like that's real of course and um and to Stage a coup against an elected president who supposedly got 15 million more votes in any president where all the the Biden voters nobody even cares about all that stuff none of that was ever real now they're admitting it's not real and it's just the people with the guns are in charge it does feel that way way I'm that does not surprise me based on what I've seen in the United States over the past 20 years so I don't think you know I look as long as we're throwing out all of our standards and norms and traditions and we're starting at year zero which is clearly the goal here when comma says you know we're unburdened by the past what she's really saying is that's welcome to campuchia exactly um then we should just be completely honest about everything all the time why not I mean they already would kill you if they could so why don't just be totally honest and I'm just kind of interested in this idea of female political leadership being this thing that it it demonstrably isn't and so why do we feel why does the right feel like we have to go along with these pities which are clearly lies like why let's just stop doing that this is not plausible this kid's a 20-year-old much bullied socially awkward weird kid who washes out of the rifle team because he can't he's got no social media profile he his search history suggests no Research into any of this and he he already he sounds way too sophisticated cson questions the secret service's failure asking how a counter sniper could Overlook a man with a rifle just 140 yards away and not neutralize the threat so how from the video we we have all seen the counter sniper secret service counter sniper is lying prone and he clearly has the shooter in his in his glasses he's looking at him he does not the sniper until after the sniper Trump how how could a a secret service counter sniper look at a man with a rifle 140 yards away and not him I don't understand that this is the point where the Secret Service is incumbent on them to prove that they didn't allow this kid to Trump because it certainly looks like they did allow it and so I don't understand where you know why there isn't a delegation of senators and members of Congress and citizens standing outside blocking the entrance to the Secret Service headquarters to find you know answer the question you are I think based on everything you've said they are presumed guilty now they may not be guilty but they have an obligation to explain how they're not guilty and no one is forcing that explanation the attempted of trump just shows how serious these people are how high the stakes are and I just hope people are internalizing that lesson but they don't seem to be at all Biden was the worst president in the history of our country she's acknowledged to be the worst vice president in the history of our country she doesn't have a clue you know if she doesn't have a teleprompter she can't even speak did you see her the other night they put a camera in her face she can't even talk we just went through four years let's not go through another four Trump criticizes the Biden administration's deals asserting that his leadership rectified those detrimental agreements restoring normaly we got our people back but boy we make some horrible horrible deals and it's nice to say we got them back but does that set a bad precedent Bert right does that set a bad does that set a bad precedent Bert Harris has the most Ultra leftwing agenda of any presidential candidate ever in history there's never been anybody like this she is considered more left-wing than crazy Bernie Sanders look at her she's worse than Bernie and she happens to be really a low IQ individual she really does she has a very low IQ we don't need a low IQ president shei of China said oh good we have another one a low IQ individual they love dealing with low IQ they love dealing with low IQ people and they got them here I'll tell you we got them all she is terrible she's worse than he I think she's worse than him by the way they really took it away from the guy right I don't feel sorry for him because he's a bad guy you know he's weaponized the whole thing and nobody's ever done that in this country but he's a bad guy but uh people feel sorry for him they did a coup he just doesn't know it but actually he does know it you know that they said Joe you got 14 million votes it's yours but you're going to give it up going to give it up right now Joe you're giving it up right now no I'm not I was elected democratically I was elected now you're giving it up Jo we're either going to do it the nice way or the hard way Joe you're getting the hell out for the most part uh people are protected by their unions by their police unions or by their police departments but I'm saying if if I felt or if if a group of people would feel that somebody was being unfairly prosecuted because the person did a good job maybe with or made a mistake an innocent mistake there's a big difference between being a bad person and making an innocent mistake but if somebody made an innocent mistake I would want to help that person he also claims that illegal immigrants are being welcomed into the country with the promise of votes undermining the Democratic process I can tell you this right now you have illegal aliens coming in to our country many from prisons and many from uh mental institutions and they want to give them votes I don't think they should have votes they came into our country illegally and they're taking the vote away from all of the people in this room that have been here a long time that have worked hard that in many cases and you'll see this happening if I'm Not Elected you're going to see it happening if I am you're not going to have any problem but you're going to see it happening a long time you're going to see the people in this room and people outside of this room are going to be losing their jobs the people that have come into this country illegally I think it's a very rude introduction I don't know exactly why you would do something like that and let me go a step further I was invited here and I was told my opponent whether it was Biden or Camala uh I was told my opponent was going to be here it turned out my opponent isn't here you invited me under false pretense and then you said you can't do it with zoom well you know where's Zoom she's going to do it with zoom and she's not coming and then you were half an hour late just so we understand I have too much respect for you to be late they couldn't get their equipment working or something Mr President I would love I have answer the question you another I have been the best president for the black population since Abraham Lincoln that's my answer I watched the video of what happened in Butler Pennsylvania about 1550 times I think I was one of about 8 billion people around the world who watched it and the more I watched it the more it struck me that everything was different after that moment everything this convention is different the nation is different the world is different Donald Trump is different when he stood up after being in the face bloodied and put his hand up I thought at that moment that was a transformation this was no longer a man well I think that I think it was divine intervention the attempt on Trump's life instead of weakening him solidified his position as the leader of the nation a pivotal moment in his career but the effect that it had on Donald Trump he was no longer just a political party's nominee or a former president or a future president this was the leader of a Nation I think there's a difference I think I mean I'm I've spent most of my life in Washington where the you know the president is the at the top of the pyramid every wants to be the president but if you think about in the presidency comes with great power obviously but if you think about it that is a title that is bestowed by a process of some sort that can be subverted and in the end it does not confer by itself as no title does legitimacy just cuz you call yourself the president doesn't mean that much inherently I can call my dog the CEO of huet Packard it doesn't mean she is you know it's it's true and you hate to say it but it is also true is a fact that you could take I don't know a mannequin a person and make him president if you no you could you could I'm just saying theoretically possible with enough with enough cheating that could happen but being a leader is very different it's not a title it's organic you can't name someone a leader a leader is the bravest man that's who the leader is that is true in all human organizations this is a law of Nature and in that moment Donald Trump months before the presidential election became the leader of this nation that was the most obvious to me and I have to say you know I I I think it changed him I I know Trump expressed his amazement at The crowd's Bravery and composure during the tragedy noting how they didn't flee in panic reached out to Trump within hours of it that night and what he said to me that night having just been in the face he said not a single word about himself he said only how amazed he was and how proud he was of the crowd which didn't run and I thought two things the first thing I thought was well of course they didn't run his courage gave them heart a leader courage gives courage to his people and the second thing I thought was this is the selfish guy I've been hearing about for 9 years really not a word about himself about his people period and the second thing I notice which I don't think anyone has remarked upon in public but I'm just going to since I don't have a script like why not is that he turned down the most obvious opportunity in politics to inflame the nation after being to inflame the nation which is an opportunity that almost every other politician I've ever met and certainly his opponents would have taken instantly and they would have said well what is this how did he get like how did this happen and those are real questions that we have to get to the bottom of but in the moments the days the week after he did not say that he did his best to bring the country together and I thought this is the divisive figure this is the irresponsible person no this is the most responsible unifying behavior of a leader I think I've ever seen and I could go on for hours but I let me just sum it up I do think the entire point from the famous escalator ride 9 years ago until today of Donald Trump's public life has been to remind us of one fact which is a Leader's duty is to his people to his country and to no other that's the point that's the only point and another word for this is democracy Carlson states that true democracy is the belief that the citizens of a country are its rightful owners a principle Under Siege democracy in case you're a little sick of being beaten in the face with democracy on television actual democracy is the proposition that the citizens of a country own that country they're not renters they're not surfs they're not they are the owners of the country and for that to be true their leaders have to represent them which another way of saying they have to do what the people want them to do or a close approximation thereof but if they completely ignore what people want not just one year but generationally say for 50 years then it may be I don't know what it's not a democracy and so I think the entire Trump project paradoxically is attacked as an enemy of democracy is to return democracy to the United States the first thing there's there's one question about Trump that I really wanted to ask you so do you are you shocked at the fact that you're donating a substantial amount of money to facilitate Trump's election is that something you would have believed in the realm of possibility say 5 years ago and I want to diversify out into California what what's been reported in the media is is simply not true um I'm not donating $45 billion a month to Trump now now what I have done is I've I have created a a pack or super pack whatever you want to call it um some we call it the the America pack um and the you want to tell everybody who's listening what a pack is because people it's a political action committee yeah um it's an organization it's sort of a legal entity that can receive funding um that funding can then be used to help with political campaigns

stations the buildings the highspeed rail everything it's um really far more impressive than what we have in the US recommend somebody just go to Shanghai and Beijing look at the buildings and go to take the train from Beijing to Shian where you have the Terracotta Warriors from the ancient new Silk Road connecting powerful continents to a groundbreaking football stadium that's also a shopping Haven and a huge water transfer plan shaping up for the next 40 years China is showing how much they care about engineering creativity and space let's look into some of the biggest Mega projects still under construction in China China has always been known for preserving culture and honoring ancestral beliefs so it wasn't a shocker when President xiin ping in 2013 unveiled a Visionary plan to revive the ancient Silk Road One wondering how ancient it is and what it represents well centuries ago Chinese Traders embarked on Journeys trading silk along a network of Roads connecting Asia and Europe This was the OG global trade route the ancient trade route connected China and Europe during the days of the Roman Empire transporting Oriental silk to Europe it played a crucial role in historical exchange and spread of valuable Goods around the continent the route was still in use until 1453 CE when the Ottoman Empire closed off trade with the West in 2013 president Xi Jinping introduced the restoration initiative changing the name from Silk Road to the belt and Road initiative B the economic belt along the Silk Road is home to almost 3 billion people and represents the biggest Market in the world with unparalleled potential China plans to invest heavily in the project with the estimated money spent expected to hit a staggering 1.3 $3 trillion by 2027 now that's crazy another Mega project in China is the south north water transfer project this project is set to reshape China's water landscape the project is not the typical Quick Fix it's a multi-decade wonder that has already spanned 50 years from conception to commencement with an anticipated 40 more years of construction yes it's going to take 40 years to get completed the idea for the south to North Water diversion project dates back to the early days of the People's Republic of China in 1952 Mao Zedong first proposed the idea of diverting water from the south to the north to address China's water scarcity problem but after more than 50 years the project was officially launched in 2003 with a total budget of more than $79 billion made up of three main routes the eastern central and Western route it is one of the largest lest and most ambitious water transfer projects in the world by the year 2050 when this ambitious project is set to be completed a staggering 44.8 billion cubic M of water will flow annually the water transfer project isn't just about redirecting water it's about connecting China's four major rivers the yangi Yellow River Hui and highi Via three meticulously planned routes that snake across the eastern central and Western regions of the country China is estimating to spend about $62 billion on this huge Masterpiece a price tag that surpasses even the controversial Three Gorges Dam stretching an incredible 4,350 km the project will impact the lives of over 500 million people serving as evidence of China's unending engineering Ambitions yet another massive engineering feat is changdu Metro with this Urban rail line weaving its way through the vibrant Sichuan Province China is taking us on a journey through time and space where every station tells a story December 2022 marked a pivotal moment in Chung's history as the Metro was unveiled with a network of 12 lines spanning 58.9 6 km these aren't mere lines on a map they are links connecting communities and cultures the line passes through 373 operational stations seamlessly linked by 46 transfer stations chengdu's Metro story started in 2005 with the approval of lines 1 and two with line one making its first debut on September 27th 2010 in no distant time the system evolved into a Labyrinth of 12 Subway Lines and one light rail line phase 3 came in 2016 unveiling five new lines marking a chapter of unprecedented expansion with this phase changdu Metro became the fourth largest subway system in the World in 2019 the fourth phase of the Metro began introducing eight new lines the ongoing fifth phase unveiled in 2023 promises a substantial addition with 10 new lines covering 199.95 Chang du's rail Transit network will sprawl over 700 km China is also looking at integrating an AI by 2025 to seamlessly guide the entire operation showcasing a commitment to technological advancement changdu Metro will carve its Mark as the pioneer of AI maintenance robots a groundbreaking development that propels the metro into the realm of artificial intelligence similar to changdu Metro is another exceptional billion doll project the Chongqing Kunming High-Speed Rail Project this high-speed rail network whose cost is expected to run into billions will pass through the Three Gorges area it is designed to handle bullet trains which will effortlessly race through the mountains at a speed of 350 kilm hour China already boasts about 40,000 km of High-Speed Rail with the eight vertical and eight horizontal Chongqing Kunming high-speed Railway spanning over 1,60 km nestled within this expansive Network previously a journey from Chongqing kunun Ming to Beijing took a substantial 20 hours aboard ordinary trains with the introduction of High-Speed Rail travel time is expected to fall to 7 hours how incredible another ongoing Mega project in the country is hyan Island located in the South China Sea off the southern coast is the second largest island in China after Taiwan known as hyan Island the hyan international tourism Island project is being developed by the China State Council the project was first announced in 2010 and it was officially launched in 2011 the total investment for the project is estimated to be around $50 billion and the project is overseen by the hon provincial government and a number of other government agencies a number of international companies are also involved in the project including major hotel chains and theme park operators although the island has long been a popular tourist destination for domestic Travelers in China the new tourism project aim seems to attract more International visitors the main airport serving the island is haiku Maan International Airport which is undergoing expansion as part of the hyan project the Island's capital city is hio and its largest city is Sonia the hyan international tourism Island project is expected to be completed by 2025 however the development of the island is an ongoing process and it's likely that new projects and developments will continue after 2025 the project is already making a significant impact on hyan with tourism numbers growing rapidly in recent years in 2019 the island welcomed over 70 million tourists and the goal is to reach 100 million Visitors by 2025 so the project is already having a big impact even before it's fully completed with these projects we can see that China is taking infrastructural development seriously it's also clear how ambitious the country is these revolutionary Mega projects when completed will not only beautify their various locations they will also positively impact their local communities creating opportunities for new Industries and new businesses to thrive the result will be a more Diversified and resilient economy that can support the prosperity and well-being of China's people for generations to come so what do you think about these projects let us know in the comments section also if you like the video please give it a thumbs Thumbs Up And subscribe for more videos on Mega projects around the world thanks for tuning in see you in the next video the architecture in China that's in recent years is far more impressive than the US the the train stations the buildings the high-speed rail everything it's um really far more impressive than what we have in the US recommend somebody just go to Shanghai and Beijing look at the buildings and go to take the train from Beijing to Shan where you have the Terracotta Warriors why does China have such jaw-dropping infrastructure compared to the rest of the world it's a question that pops up whenever we Marvel at their sprawling High-Speed Rail networks futuristic cities and seemingly endless highways from gleaming airports to efficient public transit China's infrastructure is a testament to years of strategic planning and investment but what exactly has driven the incredible transformation well in today's video we will explore just that but before you continue watching please subscribe to our channel to show your support now let's talk about why China's infrastructure is so much ahead than the rest of the world economic liberalization and Investments China's journey to infrastructure greatness kicked off with major economic liberalization and reforms in the late 1970s when D xaing came to power he introduced policies that opened up China's economy to the world this was a GameChanger take for example the establishment of special economic zones like shenzen back in 1980 shenzen was a sleepy fishing Village around 300,000 inhabitants today it's a bustling Metropolis with a population of over 12 million thanks to the economic policies that attracted foreign investment and boosted industrial growth the secz strategy proved effective by taking a gradual approach to reform and greater openness towards foreign direct investment Chinese officials experimented in a controlled environment futuristic skyscrapers and jam-packed highways have overtaken the drab lowrise buildings muddy Farm fields and Bicycles of the old shenzen attracting foreign direct investment was job number one the shenen high-tech Industrial Park was established in 1996 attracting leading international firms such as Intel IBM Toshiba and Samsung these special economic zones like shenzen became hot beds of economic activity generating Revenue that could be funneled into infrastructure projects let's look at some numbers in 1980 China's GDP was around $36 billion fast forward to 2022 and it's almost $18 trillion this explosive economic growth has provided the financial backbone for massive infrastructure Investments for instance China spent around 88.5% of its GDP on infrastructure from 1992 to 2011 compared to just 2.5% in the United States during the same period this level of investment has enabled China to build worldclass highways Railways and airports at a speed and scale that other countries can only dream of one standout example is the high-speed rail network launched in 2008 China's highspeed rail now covers over 45,000 km making it the largest in the world this wasn't just about laying track it was about connecting cities boosting Regional economies and creating millions of jobs China's economic liberalization and reforms set the stage for its infrastructure Boom by opening up the economy attracting foreign investment and prioritizing Market oriented policies China created a solid Financial foundation for its incredible infrastructure advancements political will and stability when it comes to building first class infrastructure China's political will and stability play a massive role unlike many other countries China's centralized government can make Swift decisions and see long-term projects through without the usual political bickering that can slow things down elsewhere in many democracies changing governments can mean shifts in policy and priorities which can stall or even cancel infrastructure projects in China the leadership's long-term Vision ensures that projects stay on track take the south north water transfer project for instance this colossal engineering feat aimed at diverting water from the yangi river in the South to the Arid North was conceived in the 1950s and is still being executed today with parts of it already completed and operational the projects estimated cost is around $62 billion and it's a testament to China's ability to stay focused on long-term goals political will is also evident in Urban Development cities like Shanghai and Beijing have seen massive Transformations thanks to government-led initiatives shanghai's pudong District which was mostly Farmland in the early 1990s is now a Global Financial Hub with a Skyline that Rivals New York City this transformation was driven by strategic government planning and investment the ability to make quick decisions maintain long-term plans and invest heavily in transformative projects without getting bogged down by political infighting allows China to achieve Feats that seem almost impossible elsewhere human capital investment China's impressive infrastructure isn't just about money and materials it's also about people investing in human capital has been a Cornerstone of China's strategy ensuring that there's a skilled Workforce ready to build and maintain all those shiny new projects first off Let's Talk education over the past few decades China has made significant strides in improving its education system especially in science techn ology engineering and Mathematics commonly known as stem universities like ching hahaa and ping have become Global powerhouses churning out top-notch engineers and architects who are well equipped to tackle massive infrastructure projects in 2020 China produced about 4.7 million stem graduates compared to about 600,000 in the United States this massive pool of talent is critical for driving the country's infrastructure boom vocational training is another crucial aspect China has invested heavily in vocational schools and training programs to ensure that its Workforce has the practical skills needed for construction and engineering jobs the government's push for vocational education has paid off creating a highly skilled labor force that can efficiently build complex structures from skyscrapers to high-speed Railways moreover China's focus on research and development or R&D in infrastructur related fields has paid off the country invests heavily in R&D with spending reaching around 2.6% of GDP in recent years which translates to hundreds of billions of dollars China's expenditure on research and development continues to grow at a Breakneck pace and the country will likely spend more than the US soon if it doesn't already this investment helps Foster innovation in construction materials techniques and sustainability practices keeping China at The Cutting Edge of infrastructure development in summary China's infrastructure Supremacy is no accident it's the result of deliberate and strategic actions spanning economic policies political will and and human capital investment first up the economic reforms from the late 1970s kicked things off by opening up the economy and attracting investment which fueled huge infrastructure projects next China's centralized government can make quick decisions and stick with long-term plans without the delays often seen in democracies this stability and focus help keep massive projects on track finally China has poured a lot into educating and training its people creating a skilled Workforce ready to tackle big construction jobs and innovate with new technologies together these factors explain why China's infrastructure is so Advanced and sets a high standard for the rest of the world our tour started at the utong brand Center where there's a pretty comprehensive Museum covering not only utong history but that of the bus transportation industry in total you'll find models of UT's historic buses such as the sleeper buses that used to transport people across China long before the high-speed rail systems were put in place as well as their iconic smaller buses all the way up to their autonomous driving pods from today it's probably a good time to talk about UT's history because they've been making buses since back in 1968 and their first fully electric bus actually came out 25 years ago since then electric utong buses have covered over 41 billion kilm and reduced CO2 emissions by 25 million tons the equivalent of planting over 1,300 square km of trees they have four factories in total with this one being the world's largest production base for new energy buses in total they can produce around 150,000 units of buses and commercial vehicles across their for sites every year and they've been rapidly expanding their Global business exporting nearly 100,000 buses in total and more recently the EV bosses have been making their way across Europe including the UK Norway France and Poland among others after a look around the brand Center including a look at UT's vision for the year 2095 where they anticipate people will live on Mars we then took a look into the future of today hitching a ride with their autonomous pods which drove us around the factory site completely driver free the operator simply selects the location that we need to visit and off we electric bus that leaves the uong factory is subjected to this test whereby the bus drives to one end of the pool to initiate the waves then reverses back to the start to repeat the process and slowly increase the size of the Waves as you can see here water is getting into the bus down by our feet but it's having no negative impact on the bus itself now this is quite an important test because climate change has certainly increased the incidences of extreme weather around the world certainly here in China we're seeing a lot more extreme flooding caused by biblical weather events and so it's important to know that buses are not just going to leave people stranded when those events happen this process of going forwards and backwards is repeated three to five times before we emerge from the other end none the worse for the experience so you can see the water now coming out the back of the bus over there I mean it came up to came up to about here on the door which means certainly up to about the middle of the wheel there I think the actual water level that we got whil we were testing be careful fascinating so you can see the level of the wave here comes up to about 50 cm as wave washes up up and down the bus the bus goes backwards and forwards in know to generate more and more waves to get that wave level higher really do a thorough test of the battery see how the trucks how the buses paint coting Workshop this is this is the electro coating you'll see here this is the basically a completely paint free bus up here and what we're going to do is Electro coat it probably in one of these Vats down here see this one is actually being submerged into the water now into the well not the water the liquid so there's different steps here degasing to remove things like oil things like that this a second degreasing tank being dipped in to be fully cleaned up ready to be electr coat which we'll surely see by the end of the journey okay so it's not biohazard there it is goodbye [Music] bus currently you can see one has been this is a Water Rinse dip here so you can see the this one here is being rinsed once again with fresh di water spraying not sure what di is but there's a bus in there currently undergoing some water torture and you can see now this bus over here this Frame is now moving along this line to be treated in other stuff in the future and then they'll go all the way down that Corridor there I'll try and get some more beeroll this and they'll eventually come down to here to the cooling section not sure if we can see any buses in here these ones are maybe down here in this section that we might get to see later so yeah this boss is getting ready for i' got ziron iation here to PR make a zir a ziron film and this one is getting another rinse from ziron you can see you got a coach down there as well it's also being dipped absolutely pristine in here I'm sure it's probably been polished a little bit while we came in this actually wouldn't be that bad a place to work would it they do all the kind of things in here they fill in antifreeze we've got automatic antifreeze filling to make sure that all the amounts are done correctly so we've got some kind of more inspection areas over there for a brand new bus that's a pretty long one I think that's an 18 M long bus there so that one probably is going to Europe or some other markets like that see if we can dive into one of these buses here have a look at what's going on let's just stick our nose in see it's all prepared with lovely fresh seats in there all the curtains are all beautifully tied up there down to the front of the bus there's a few more final pieces being assembled in this bus down there by that fella and of course they need to put in the internal concertina here as well to protect the so here look this gu's busy installing the seat in there makeing sure the final bolts are screwed very nice buses these inside I have to say so this one actually has a dashboard installed still waiting for the you know aftermarket card scanner or whatever it is that's in your Market to be installed in there kind of fan for the driver up there as well after leaving the factory we were given the chance to peruse yutong's full range of commercial and transportation Vehicles which includes buses bendy buses coaches which are particularly popular in Scandinavia school buses just for small children this one was a cute one as well as larger commercial vehicles with a variety of powertrains including battery electric and even hydrogen fuel cells too we were then taken to see some of the primary components that go into utong Vehicles including the drivetrains and even a 1 megawatt charging pile many of these have patents for their Innovations then we were introduced to the wide variety of tests that utong perform on their buses and the materials in them they completed some pretty impressive Feats such as is driving on the highest roads on Earth trucks weighing in 1.3 M of water pulling 310 tons as well as extreme cold and Extreme Hot temperatures as well in the first test a utong motor connected to a power supply was submerged 2.4 M underwater to simulate the effect of a bus being caught in a flooded area and they do this I believe for 72 hours as you can see here even after several minutes submerged under the water the motor continues to run as normal in the second test we were able to see the effect of a nail puncture on a battery cell this has become a popular test in the industry to show the safety of a battery pack that is pierced and you can see from the video here that while smoke emerges from the battery there are no flames to follow so far so good next came the fire test with a full utong battery pack placed directly in pretty big gasoline Flames for 70 seconds the Flames as you can see they do cause damage to the casing around the pack itself causing it to bulge outwards but even after all that time there's no fire from the battery pack itself finally it was time for the side by-side test with two batteries one equipped with UT's nitrogen protection system and one without these were heated up simultaneously and around 113¬∞ the pack without the protection system emits a small explosion later followed by another and inevitable flames the nitrogen protected pack lasts much longer and goes to a higher temperature before suffering a similar explosion but no flames the purpose of the nitrogen here is to remove oxygen completely from the equation which is of course one of the three key ingredients for fire to take hold with day one over day two saw us visit the autonomous bus launch Depot where a fleet of utong u12 buses begin their autonomous Drive tests on a closed route in Jung Joo City okay so behind me you can see a couple couple of autonomous buses and what we're going to do now there's the full dashboard so basically this bus is going to drive by itself I'm going to drive out of here I'll take a seat in a minute but I'm going to show you there's going to be no one sat there while this bus is driving the bus Begins by driving out of the parking space on its own without a driver as you can see from the video here where the steering wheel is operating entirely on its own this whole system is made capable by 5G signals and of course Suite of cameras liars and sensors that can can be seen all around the bus despite all this technology by law we do still need a driver to observe and be ready to take over during these trials for safety purposes so the drive the bus drives to the bus stop within the bus terminal and our driver climbs aboard you'll see at the start of this that he keeps his hands away from the steering wheel and leaves the bus to drive itself autonomously out of the bus terminal shortly after this the driver seems to take over for a short period on the way to the autonomous ring where the buses are officially allowed to operate and then relinquishes control back to the bus once the route begins while it's a fairly simple route literally a huge circle around the business area the bus generally does a solid job avoiding incidents with other Road users and only suffering from a couple of seemingly Phantom braking incidents where it does get a little bit confused now in my experience these are fairly common in autonomous vehicles but obviously they will want to iron those out over time to avoid passengers is flying around the cabin Russia has long been gaining economic benefits by exporting natural gas to Europe but in recent years in order to find new markets they have reached a preliminary agreement with China on a natural gas project in 2021 this large scale project is expected to invest more than $13 billion in plans to build a 20 600 km natural gas pipeline to directly deliver energy to China according to the original plan the project was supposed to start construction this year and is expected to be completed within 4 years however recent discussions on the project have become somewhat complicated some Western media reported that China seems reluctant to let the pipeline pass through Mongolia but prefers to choose to bypass Kazakhstan obviously this choice will make the negotiations on the project more tortuous and it may be difficult to reach an agreement within this year so the question is why is China unwilling to let the pipeline pass through Mongolia in addition how is the progress of this project now this is the straight of Mala a narrow stretch of water located between the Malay Peninsula and the Indonesian island of Sumatra for centuries it served as the single most vital Gateway between the Indian and Pacific Oceans making it one of the most strategic and geopolitically important regions on Earth however nearby Thailand is planning to create a shortcut that would completely bypass it but what exactly is this shortcut going to be and how's it going to impact the rest of this V can talk about Thailand's plans to bypass the malaka strait we first have to understand just how important this area of the world really is looking at a map of the region it can be fairly easy to understand the geopolitical importance of this tiny stretch of water this Waterway simply speaking is the shortest possible SE route for any ship that wants to transit in and out of East Asia a region where some of the world's largest economies such as China Japan and South Korea are all located because of this the malaka strait sees more than 90,000 vessels pass through it each year making it one of the single busiest waterways in the entire world the ships that pass through this area account for a mindboggling 30% of all traded Goods globally amounting to somewhere between three and 4 trillion Us in total value each and every year what's even crazier is that nine out of the 10 busiest shipping ports in the world are all located around this same area in the Indo Pacific simply put this narrow stretch of water holds immense value not just to the countries in the surrounding area but also to the rest of the world that's why even the United States which is more than 14,000 km away still maintains a semi-permanent military presence around the area in countries like Malaysia Singapore and the Philippines they also conduct regular military exercises with those same countries along with Thailand Indonesia and brune it's in their best interest to maintain the stability of this region and make sure that no competing Powers will take the area for themselves on the other hand it also makes sense why China the world's second largest economy also wants to establish their presence over this highly contested area of the world more than 2/3 of their entire Maritime trade volume passes through the malaka and because of this China has also made significant efforts in protecting their interests in the region by claiming various islands and establishing a military presence in the nearby South China Sea and if that wasn't enough they've even begun creating artificial islands in the area where they construct various military installations but because of this huge strategic and geopolitical importance the straight of malaka is also a single point of failure in the global supply chain with more than 90,000 vessels passing through it each year this narrow Corridor can sometimes become extremely congested greatly increasing the risk of Maritime collisions or becoming a navigational Hazard for every ship that passes through and the Suez Canal was blocked for an entire week back in 2021 who knows how bad the effects could have been if it were to happen in the straight of malaka now because of this Thailand has actually been planning to create a completely new trade route that would bypass the straight of Mala in its entirety this is the CRA ismus a narrow stretch of land that connects the Malay Peninsula to the rest of the Asian Mainland at its narrowest this land form is actually just 40 km across between the curri district and the province of chumon both located in southern Thailand and with only a few kilometers separating the Gulf of Thailand on the East with the Andaman sea to the West this region almost feels like it's begging for a canal to be built right through it and Thailand is definitely thought of doing exactly that multiple times over the years the first known proposal dates all the way back to the 17th century during the rule of the Thai King norai however due to the lack of modern engineering capabilities at the time the project never really took shape beyond the conceptual stage many other proposals were suggested throughout the 17 and 1800s by both French and British Engineers but yet again none of them really materialized into anything concrete by 1897 Thailand had signed an agreement with the British Empire that forbid them from building a canal across the CW ismus without permission from the British this was done in order to maintain Singapore's role in the region as a major trading Hub controlled by the British Empire the British would continue to block all progress towards a canal in Thailand up until Singapore's Independence in 1965 which finally ended the British influence and interest in the surrounding region Thailand would continue to consider various Canal proposals across the C ismus over the next few decades however the one proposal that finally seemed like it would actually materialize into something came in 2005 from an upand cominging Global superpower China which expressed interest in funding constructing and managing the canal if it were ever to be completed this proposal was finally put into writing in 2015 when both countries signed a memorandum of understanding to finally build the long proposed Mega project there have been many different proposed routes for the Tai Canal but the one that has been studied and suggested the most would span a total of 128 km starting from the province of Krabby by the Andaman sea all the way to songcloud by the Gulf of Thailand the canal would be 400 m wide 25 M deep and would be entirely built at sea level because of this the Thai Canal wouldn't require any form of elaborate system of locks like the ones used with the Panama Canal it's estimated that this project would cost as many as8 billion us and take as long as an entire decade to complete now the most obvious benefit for building this canal would be that it would shorten the distance and the amount of time it would take for vessels to Transit between the South China seat and the Andaman seat According to some estimates this shortcut would save as many as 3 days worth of sailing and would reduce the distance traveled by at least 1200 km a decently sized oil tanker for example wouldn't save as much as 350,000 doll per trip if they were to take this hypothetical shorter route another benefit that Thailand would enjoy if the canal were ever to be actually completed is that they could potentially become a global Shipping and Logistics Hub just like neighboring Singapore the project would also help Revitalize the relatively poorer and more rural Southern provinces of the country by providing jobs and economic opportunities to the entire region they would then have an alternate route for their imports and exports to completely bypass the malaka straight an area that's almost completely surrounded by the United States and its Southeast Asian Ally could also possibly anger the United States and India by allowing Chinese vessels to freely navigate between the South China Sea directly into the Andaman SE and the Indian Ocean thereby putting Thailand in a very precarious position in an already geopolitically complex one build and managed the project in the first place has now found an alternative solution to their malaka straight problem through the China Pakistan economic Corridor China now has an alternate route for their oil and gas imports from the Middle East then in February of 2018 Thailand's prime minister pryu Chan oat even declared to the public that the Thai Canal was not a priority of the government stating that the project was still pending a study and that there are still other problems in the area that first need to be prioritized finally in September 2020 it was ultimately decided by the Thai Government after months of feasibility studies that the proposed cro Canal which would have been funded and constructed by China will no longer push through [Music] [Music] ch [Music] by [Music] he who Jo [Music] [Music] for for [Music] oh who you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for by [Music] by [Music] far for
